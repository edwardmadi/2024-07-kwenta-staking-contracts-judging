# ’Reward calculation‘ #Frequent updates of lastUpdateTime for small stakes may affect the reward calculation for previous stakers

### Summary

In StakingRewardsV2.sol:415, the contract updates lastUpdateTime to the current time and calculates the reward based on the new rewardPerTokenStored. If user A stakes a sum of money, if other users frequently stake small amounts or perform any other actions that trigger updateReward, lastUpdateTime will be constantly updated. This will cause user A, who has not received rewards for a long time, to find that the reward growth rate slows down when calculating the reward, and in extreme cases, the reward received will be very small.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The contract can perform normal staking and reward logic

### Attack Path

1. Whenever a user performs a reward-related operation (such as staking, claiming rewards, etc.), the updateReward method is called.
2. In the updateReward method, the contract calculates the reward based on lastTimeRewardApplicable and lastUpdateTime.
3. If lastUpdateTime is updated frequently, the actual time interval for reward calculation will be shortened, and the reward growth will also decrease.

### Impact

If lastUpdateTime is updated frequently, the actual time interval for reward calculation will be shortened, and the reward growth will also decrease.
