        updateReward(_account)
    {
        uint256 reward = rewards[_account];
        if (reward > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewards[_account] = 0;


            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);


            // transfer token from this contract to the rewardEscrow
            // and create a vesting entry at the _to address
            kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);
            rewardEscrow.appendVestingEntry(_to, reward);
        }


        uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account];
        if (rewardUSDC > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;


            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);


            // transfer token from this contract to the account
            // as newly issued rewards from inflation are now issued as non-escrowed
            usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
        }
    }
