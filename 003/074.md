# Blacklisted users by USDC contract will not be able to claim their Kwenta token rewards

### Summary

The **_getReward()** transfers both **USDC** and **KWENTA** in a single function. If the user is blacklisted by USDC then the transfer call will revert. Because of which **exit()**, **compound()**, **getReward()** & **getRewardOnBehalf()** will always revert for such users and their **KWENTA** rewards will be stuck too.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L382` the transfer will revert for blacklisted users

### Mitigation

The protocol can take 1 of 2 approaches suggested below:

- Send **USDC** to a claim contract and user can claim their **USDC** from there.
