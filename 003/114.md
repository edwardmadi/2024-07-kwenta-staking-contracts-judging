# Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerability in `_getReward` Function Due to Blacklisted USDC Recipient

## Summary
The `_getReward` function in the contract allows users to claim rewards in both KWENTA and USDC. However, if a user is blacklisted by the USDC token contract, the usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC) call will revert, preventing the entire function from executing. This results in a Denial of Service (DoS) where the user cannot claim their KWENTA rewards either, despite the blacklisting only affecting USDC transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
User calls `stake` function when user was not blacklisted by USDC, suppose after a time passes and user address is blacklisted, then When a user calls the `_getReward` function, the function attempts to transfer both KWENTA and USDC rewards. If the user is blacklisted by the USDC token contract which is upgradeable, the usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC) call will fail and revert the transaction. This causes the entire _getReward function to fail, including the successful transfer of KWENTA rewards, which is a DoS vulnerability.

## Impact
Denial of Service: Users who are blacklisted by the USDC token contract will be unable to claim their KWENTA rewards due to the failure of the USDC transfer, causing the entire function to revert.

```javascript

    function _getReward(address _account, address _to)
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        updateReward(_account)
    {
        uint256 reward = rewards[_account];
        if (reward > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewards[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);

            // transfer token from this contract to the rewardEscrow
            // and create a vesting entry at the _to address
            kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);
            rewardEscrow.appendVestingEntry(_to, reward);
        }

        uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account];
        if (rewardUSDC > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);

            // transfer token from this contract to the account
            // as newly issued rewards from inflation are now issued as non-escrowed
            usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 separate the claim logic for KWENTA and USDC rewards into distinct functions. This ensures that the failure of one does not affect the other
