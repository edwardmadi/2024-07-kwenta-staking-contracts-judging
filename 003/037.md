# A user would not be able to claim his Kwenta rewards if he was blocklisted by USDC.


## Summary

A user would not be able to claim his Kwenta rewards if he was blocklisted by USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail

Background: User can claim rewards in `StakingRewardsV2.sol` by the external `getReward()` function. There are two types of rewards: Kwenta token and USDC token.

The issue is, the two tokens are claimed in a single function, which means if a user is blocklisted by USDC, not only would he be unable to withdraw USDC rewards, he would also be able to withdraw Kwenta rewards.

One should expect to always be able to withdraw Kwenta rewards even if he was blocklisted by USDC.

```solidity
    function getReward() external {
        _getReward(msg.sender);
    }

    function _getReward(address _account, address _to)
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        updateReward(_account)
    {
        uint256 reward = rewards[_account];
        if (reward > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewards[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);

            // transfer token from this contract to the rewardEscrow
            // and create a vesting entry at the _to address
            kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);
            rewardEscrow.appendVestingEntry(_to, reward);
        }

        uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account];
        if (rewardUSDC > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);

            // transfer token from this contract to the account
            // as newly issued rewards from inflation are now issued as non-escrowed
@>          usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
        }
    }
```

Further more, since the rewards are sent to `StakingRewardsV2.sol` by `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol`, and what `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol` does is it dumps all USDC that belongs to it to `StakingRewardsV2.sol`. This means even if admins don't provide USDC rewards, some random user can transfer USDC to `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol`, and make sure stakers receive USDC rewards.

StakingRewardsNotifier.sol
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
        uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
        kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
>       uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
>       usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);

        stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
    }
```

## Impact

A user would not be able to claim his Kwenta rewards if he was blocklisted by USDC.

## Recommendation

Split the reward claim into 2 different functions, one for Kwenta token, one for USDC.
