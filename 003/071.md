# USDC blacklisted staker can not get `Kwenta` reward tokens

## Summary

When receiving rewards, stakers obtain both Kwenta and USDC simultaneously in a single transaction. Consequently, if a staker is blacklisted and cannot receive USDC, the entire transaction is reversed, which also prevents the receipt of Kwenta.

## Vulnerability Detail

As demonstrated in the `_getReward()` function, USDC rewards are sent at `L382`, while Kwenta rewards are processed at `L368` and `L369`. However, if the account is on the USDC blacklist, the transfer of USDC to that account will fail, causing the entire transaction to revert and preventing the receipt of Kwenta rewards as well. Furthermore, those Kwenta rewards will be locked.

```solidity
    function _getReward(address _account, address _to)
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        updateReward(_account)
    {
        uint256 reward = rewards[_account];
        if (reward > 0) {
            // update state (first)
            rewards[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);

            // transfer token from this contract to the rewardEscrow
            // and create a vesting entry at the _to address
368         kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);
369         rewardEscrow.appendVestingEntry(_to, reward);
        }

        uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account];
        if (rewardUSDC > 0) {
            // update state (first)
375         rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;

            // emit reward claimed event and index account
            emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);

            // transfer token from this contract to the account
            // as newly issued rewards from inflation are now issued as non-escrowed
382         usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

A staker on the USDC blacklist will be unable to receive Kwenta rewards, and those rewards will be frozen.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `_getReward()` function should be enhanced to account for the USDC blacklist. For blacklisted accounts, `rewardsUSDC[_account]` should remain unchanged and not be reset to 0 at `L375`.
