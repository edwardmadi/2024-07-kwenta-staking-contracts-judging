# USDC is upgradeable but in StakingRewardsV2 contract it is set as immutable

## Summary
Setting USDC address in immutable variable may force the protocol to redeploy the StakingRewardsV2 contact.
## Vulnerability Detail
The USDC contract is upgradeable, reference: [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85#code) & [here](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0xded3b9a8dbedc2f9cb725b55d0e686a81e6d06dc#code). In StakingRewardsV2 contract the USDC address is set in an immutable variable. The problem is that if any upgrade is done with USDC then protocol will have to redeploy the StakingRewardsV2 contract.

## Impact
Protocol will have to redeploy the StakingRewardsV2 contract if any upgrade of USDC.
