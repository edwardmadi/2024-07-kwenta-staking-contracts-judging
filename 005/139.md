# Missing Storage Gaps in Upgradeable Smart Contract

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract is designed to be an upgradeable smart contract using the OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts library. However, the contract does not include storage `gaps`, which are essential for maintaining the storage layout when the contract is upgraded in the future.

## Impact

Without storage gaps, adding new state variables in future upgrades can corrupt the storage layout, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially critical vulnerabilities. This can compromise the integrity and functionality of the contract, affecting all users and stakeholders.

If we later decide to add a new state variable, such as `uint256 public newVariable;`, the storage layout will be altered. This can lead to the new variable overwriting existing storage slots, causing data corruption.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

By including storage gaps, we ensure that the StakingRewardsV2 contract remains upgradeable and can accommodate future changes without risking storage layout corruption
