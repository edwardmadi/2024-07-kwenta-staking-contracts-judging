# Missing Storage Gap

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2` is an `upgradable contract`, and it lacks a `storage gap`, which can lead to storage collisions during contract upgrades. This absence could corrupt storage and disrupt the functionality contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `upgradeable contracts`, especially those inheriting from multiple base contracts, it is critical to include a `storage gap` in base contracts to ensure that `new state variables` introduced in future versions do not overwrite existing ones in derived contracts.

For example, in the `StakingRewardsV2` contract, there is no `storage gap` declared, which could lead to unintended storage corruption if the base contract is upgraded in the future.

```solidity
contract StakingRewardsV2 is
    IStakingRewardsV2,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable
{
    // existing code...

}
```

## Impact
Without `storage gaps`, introducing new state variables inside the contract could potentially overwrite the initial storage layout of the child contracts, leading to severe malfunction or unintended behaviors in the system.

## Tools Used
- Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this risk, it is recommended to include a `storage gap` in the contract. This can be done by adding a reserved space at the end of the contractâ€™s storage layout, as shown below:

```diff
contract StakingRewardsV2 is
    IStakingRewardsV2,
    Ownable2StepUpgradeable,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    UUPSUpgradeable
{
    // existing code...

    // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
+   uint256[50] private __gap;
}
```

This `storage gap` will safeguard against storage collisions and ensure that future upgrades can be made without risking unintended side effects.
