# Missing gap at the end of an upgraded contract

### Summary

The `token\contracts\StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract is an upgrade aimed to include USDC as a new reward.

This new implementation includes several new state variables such as : `mapping(address => uint256) public rewardsUSDC`.

In upgradeable contracts, it is required to include a storage gap to anticipate for new state variables. This is already included in the `UUPSUpgradeable` contract that `StakingRewardsV2` inherits from.

### Root Cause

However, as stated [by Openzeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades-plugins/1.x/writing-upgradeable#storage-gaps) this variable size MUST be reduced appropriately.

This requirement is missing in `StakingRewardsV2`.

### Impact

In case the state contract keeps growing overtime and gets upgraded multiple times, the proxy won't be able to handle the new variables correctly and will eventually break.

### Mitigation

Overwrite the `__gap` variable with the new size.
