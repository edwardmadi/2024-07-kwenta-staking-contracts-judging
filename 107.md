# User unstake/getReward methods should not have a `whenNotPaused` modifier

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_getReward`, `unstake` and `unstakeEscrow` methods in `StakingRewardsV2.sol` have a `whenNotPaused` modifier.
This opens up an attack vector, where the protocol owner can decide if the users are able to withdraw/claim any funds from it. 
## Impact
Users won't be able to  unstake or get their rewards
