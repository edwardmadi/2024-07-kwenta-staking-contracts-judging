# ```rewardRate``` of the weeks when there is no user activity is not included in the calculation.

## Summary
Variables ```rewardRate``` and ```rewardRateUsdc``` in StakingRewardsV2.sol are updated weekly when the ```notifyRewardAmount``` is called by StakingRewardsNotifier.sol. The variables that store how much each token has earned are ```rewardPerTokenStored``` and ```rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC``` which are only updated whenever a user interacts with the protocol. The weeks when there is no user activity are not considered in those two variables and will be be updated by the latest week's ```rewardRate``` and ```rewardRateUsdc```
## Vulnerability Detail
The rates are calculated based on how much Kwenta and USDC are transferred during the ```rewardsDuration``` which is set as 1 week. Therefore, each week has its own rate which leads to ```rewardRate``` and ```rewardRateUsdc``` to store the latest week's rate.  In the condition when there is no user activity for the entire week(highly possible in the bear market) and rates are updated with the following week's values,  ```rewardPerTokenStored``` and ```rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC``` will be updated only with the latest rate when a user activity happens. If the week with no activity had a lower rate the protocol will loose funds, or if it had higher rate the users will loose funds. This may be non issue if the reward rate is constant but private communication with the protocol team confirmed that the reward rates will fluctuate depending on how well Kwenta is doing.
## Impact
Either the protocol or the users loose funds depending on the reward rate difference between the week(s) of inactivity and the latest update.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update ```rewardPerTokenStored``` and ```rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC``` within the ```notifyRewardAmount``` function after updating the rates so it does not depend only on user activity.
