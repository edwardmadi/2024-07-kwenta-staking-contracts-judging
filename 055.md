# `kwenta` could be locked due to rounding

## Summary

The `rewardRate` is calculated by rounding down [`reward / rewardsDuration`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L651), which causes dust tokens cannot being distributed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `rewardRate` for distributing rewards is calculated using the formula [reward / rewardsDuration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L651). This method rounding down the rewards, resulting in dust tokens that cannot be distributed. While the contract owner can recover dust USDC tokens through the [recoverERC20](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L710) function, the Kwenta tokens remain locked in the contract.

As these dust Kwenta tokens accumulate over time and cannot be recovered by [recoverERC20()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L710), they will be locked. 

## Impact
Kwenta reward tokens being locked.
