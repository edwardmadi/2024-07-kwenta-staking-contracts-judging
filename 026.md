## Summary
Functions guaranteed to revert when called by normal users can be marked payable
## Vulnerability Detail
Using a function modifier such as 'onlyOwner' will cause the function to revert if a normal user attempts to call it. Marking the function as 'payable' reduces the gas cost for legitimate callers since the compiler will not perform checks to determine if a payment was provided.
## Impact
Some additional gas consumption occurs.
