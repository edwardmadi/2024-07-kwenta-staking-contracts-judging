# `balanceAtTime` Function Returns Nearest Balance Instead of Exact Balance

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `balanceAtTime` function in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract is designed to return the balance of an account `at a specific timestamp`. However, the current implementation of the `_checkpointBinarySearch` function, which is used by `balanceAtTime` and other functions, returns the balance at the closest checkpoint that is not greater than the given timestamp. This behavior can lead to incorrect results when an exact balance at a specific timestamp is required.

## Impact

The `_checkpointBinarySearch` function returns the balance at the closest checkpoint that is not greater than the given timestamp. This can lead to incorrect results when an exact balance at a specific timestamp is required. For example, if the checkpoints are as follows:

```solidity
Checkpoint[] checkpoints = [
    Checkpoint({ts: 100, value: 50}),
    Checkpoint({ts: 200, value: 100}),
    Checkpoint({ts: 300, value: 150})
];

```
And we call `balanceAtTime` with _timestamp = 250, the function will return 100 (the balance at timestamp 200), even though there is no checkpoint at 250.
 **Expected Behavior**

The `balanceAtTime` function should return the balance only if the exact timestamp is found in the checkpoints. If the exact timestamp is not found, it should return `0` or an appropriate error.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function balanceAtTime(address _account, uint256 _timestamp) external view returns (uint256) {
    return _checkpointBinarySearch(balancesCheckpoints[_account], _timestamp);
}

```

```solidity
function _checkpointBinarySearch(Checkpoint[] storage _checkpoints, uint256 _timestamp)
    internal
    view
    returns (uint256)
{
    uint256 length = _checkpoints.length;
    if (length == 0) return 0;

    uint256 min = 0;
    uint256 max = length - 1;

    if (_checkpoints[min].ts > _timestamp) return 0;
    if (_checkpoints[max].ts <= _timestamp) return _checkpoints[max].value;

    while (max > min) {
        uint256 midpoint = (max + min + 1) / 2;
        if (_checkpoints[midpoint].ts <= _timestamp) min = midpoint;
        else max = midpoint - 1;
    }

    assert(min == max);

    return _checkpoints[min].value;
}

```

## Recommendation

As the function name suggest Modify the _checkpointBinarySearch function to return the balance only if the exact timestamp is found. If the exact timestamp is not found, return 0.
