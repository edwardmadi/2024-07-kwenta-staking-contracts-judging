# Risk of DOS Due to Immutable Contract Reference

### Summary

There is an issue in the design of the StakingRewardsNotifier contract that hinges on the immutability of the supplySchedule address. The onlySupplySchedule modifier restricts access to certain functions, which can only be called by the SupplySchedule contract. If for any reason, whether for an upgrade or an error correction, the SupplySchedule contract needs to be replaced, the StakingRewardsNotifier would be unable to recognize the new SupplySchedule due to the immutable declaration. This would render the notifier unable to perform its function, potentially halting the operation of the staking rewards distribution mechanism.

### Root Cause

in [StakingRewardsNotifier:27](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L27) the SupplySchedule address is immutable.
in [StakingRewardsNotifier:88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88) the function is only callable by only onlySupplySchedule 

Because of this, once the StakingRewardsNotifier contract is deployed, the supplySchedule address cannot be changed. If the SupplySchedule address ever needs to be updated (which is a common requirement in long-lived systems to fix bugs, improve functionality, or even for upgradability reasons), then StakingRewardsNotifier would be stuck pointing to an outdated or potentially deprecated contract.

### Impact

The inability to update contract relationships or dependencies could lead to operational failures, where parts of the system may stop functioning if the expected behavior of the linked contract changes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the immutable declaration with a regular state variable that can be modified by an admin function. For instance:

```solidity
ISupplySchedule public supplySchedule;

function setSupplySchedule(address _newSupplySchedule) external onlyOwner {
    require(_newSupplySchedule != address(0), "Invalid address");
    supplySchedule = ISupplySchedule(_newSupplySchedule);
    emit SupplyScheduleUpdated(_newSupplySchedule);
}
```
