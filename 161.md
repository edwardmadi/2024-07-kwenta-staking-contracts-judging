# Vulnerability in Staking Reward Distribution: Potential Front-running Attack by Minimal Wei Staking

## Summary
An attacker can exploit the `notifyRewardAmount()` function by front-running the transaction to stake a minimal amount (1 wei). This inflates the share price, allowing the attacker to claim a disproportionately large amount of the distributed rewards until other users participate in staking.

## Vulnerability Detail
The notifyRewardAmount() function is intended to calculate the reward rate and distribute rewards over a specified duration. However, it does not account for potential front-running attacks. An attacker can front-run the transaction by staking a minimal amount of 1 wei just before the reward is notified. This action inflates the share price significantly, enabling the attacker to receive the total distributed reward amount.

## Impact
This vulnerability allows the attacker to monopolize the rewards distributed by the notifyRewardAmount() function until other users stake their tokens. It effectively denies rewards to legitimate participants and results in an unfair distribution of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Minimum Stake Requirement: Introduce a minimum stake requirement to prevent negligible amounts from inflating the share price.
