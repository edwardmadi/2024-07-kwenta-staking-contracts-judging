# {Attacker} will {prevent from changing `rewardsDuration`} {admin}

### Summary

Attacker can prevent admin from executing `StakingRewardsV2.sol#setRewardsDuration` function using front-run.


- [token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L670](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/tree/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L670)

### Root Cause

The initial value of `rewardsDuration` is `1 weeks` and admin changes it by calling the following `StakingRewardsV2.sol#setRewardsDuration` function:
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
670:    if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
As can be seen, if `block.timestamp <= periodFinish` in `L670`, the function reverts.
Attacker can use this vulnerability to prevent admin from setting new rewards duration.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `StakingRewardsV2.sol#setRewardsDuration` to set new `rewardsDuration` value.
2. Attacker can front-run admin's tx by calling `SupplySchedule.sol#mint` function because it has no authority check for caller.
3. The execution goes through `SupplySchedule.sol#mint` -> `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#notifyRewardAmount` -> `StakingRewardsV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount` and finally set `periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration` as follows.
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        ......
664:    periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```
4. After that, admin's tx will revert by the condition in `L670`.

### Impact

Admin can never change `rewardsDuration` forever due to front-run attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to remove the condition on `L670` as follows.
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
--      if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
If necessary, also modify the `StakingRewardsV2.sol#getRewardForDuration` function accordingly.
