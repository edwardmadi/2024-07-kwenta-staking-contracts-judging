# Wrong check for block Number in `StakingRewardsV2::_addCheckpoint`

## Summary
wrong check in `StakingRewardsV2::_addCheckpoint` function will lead to DOS in user related external functions

## Vulnerability Detail
`StakingRewardsV2::_addCheckpoint` function is used to add or modify the checkpoints and is used by `_addBalancesCheckpoint`, `_addEscrowedBalancesCheckpoint`, `_addTotalSupplyCheckpoint`, to add the snapshot of users value staked. According to the natspec of `StakingRewardsV2::_addCheckpoint` function, `If the last checkpoint is from a different block, a new checkpoint is added.If it's from the current block, the value of the last checkpoint is updated.` but in the function, instead of checking this using `block.number` it uses global variable `block.timestamp` and compares it with the `Checkpoint.ts` value of  recent checkpoint pushed in the array, if it is same then `Checkpoint.value` parameter is modified otherwise a new checkpoint struct is added to array. Due to this issue instead of `Checkpoint.value` being modified, everytime a new struct will be added to the array. there will be new checkpoint added each time user stakes, unstakes, stakes escrow or unstakes escrow.

## Impact
These functions `balanceAtTime`, `escrowedBalanceAtTime`, `totalSupplyAtTime` will be unusable as these functions use internal function `_checkpointBinarySearch` which takes an checkpoint array and timestamp as parameters and iterates over that array reading storage in a while loop to check for required checkpoint snapshot. As the call to these functions will exceed block gas limit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```javascript
function _addCheckpoint(Checkpoint[] storage checkpoints, uint256 _value) internal {
        uint256 length = checkpoints.length;
-        uint256 lastTimestamp;
-        unchecked {
-            lastTimestamp = length == 0 ? 0 : checkpoints[length - 1].ts;
-        }
+       uint256 lastBlockNumber = checkpoints[length -1].blk;

        
-        if (lastTimestamp != block.timestamp) {
+        if (lastBlockNumber != block.number)
            checkpoints.push(
                Checkpoint({
                    ts: uint64(block.timestamp),
                    blk: uint64(block.number),
                    value: uint128(_value)
                })
            );
        } else {
            unchecked {
                
                checkpoints[length - 1].value = uint128(_value);
            }
        }
}

```
