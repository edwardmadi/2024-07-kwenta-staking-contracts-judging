# Blocklisted Address Can Trap Funds in `StakingRewardsV2` (StakingRewardsV2::_getReward)

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract allows users to stake tokens and earn rewards in both KWENTA and USDC. However, USDC has a contract-level admin-controlled address blocklist. If either the `StakingRewardsV2` contract address or a user's address is added to this blocklist, transfers to and from the contract will be forbidden, effectively trapping funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract includes functions for staking, unstaking, and claiming rewards. Users can earn rewards in `KWENTA` and `USDC`. The relevant functions for claiming rewards are `getReward()` and `_getReward()`.

The `_getReward()` function is responsible for transferring the earned rewards to the user. It first transfers KWENTA tokens to the `rewardEscrow` contract and then transfers USDC tokens directly to the user. The function is defined as follows:

360:             // update state (first)
361:             rewards[_account] = 0;
362: 
363:             // emit reward claimed event and index account
364:             emit RewardPaid(_account, reward);
365: 
366:             // transfer token from this contract to the rewardEscrow
367:             // and create a vesting entry at the _to address
368:             kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);
369:             rewardEscrow.appendVestingEntry(_to, reward);
370:         }

373:         if (rewardUSDC > 0) {

375:             rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;
376: 
377:             // emit reward claimed event and index account
378:             emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);
379: 
380:             // transfer token from this contract to the account
381:             // as newly issued rewards from inflation are now issued as non-escrowed
382:             usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC); // <== HERE
383:         }
384:     }


```

The issue arises because USDC has a contract-level admin-controlled address blocklist. If the `StakingRewardsV2` contract address or a user's address is added to this blocklist, the `usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC)` call will fail, preventing users from claiming their USDC rewards. This can happen due to regulatory actions, malicious actions by compromised token owners, or extortion attempts.

## Impact
If either the `StakingRewardsV2` contract address or a user's address is blocklisted by USDC, the transfer of USDC rewards will fail. This can result in trapped funds and financial losses for users. The inability to claim rewards can also disrupt the intended incentive structure of the staking mechanism. Additionally, it can lead to a denial of service, preventing users from interacting with the contract as intended.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice stakes tokens in the `StakingRewardsV2` contract and earns rewards in both KWENTA and USDC.
2. Alice's address is added to the USDC blocklist by the token issuer.
3. Alice attempts to claim her rewards by calling `getReward()`.
4. The `_getReward()` function is executed, and the `usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC)` call fails due to Alice's address being blocklisted.
5. Alice is unable to claim her USDC rewards, resulting in trapped funds.

## Recommendation

You should do:

- `Implement a Non-Reverting Transfer Helper Function`: Use a non-reverting transfer helper function for USDC transfers. This function should attempt the transfer and handle any failures gracefully without reverting the entire transaction. This ensures that other operations can continue even if the USDC transfer fails.

- `Emergency Withdrawal`: Provide an emergency withdrawal function that allows users to withdraw their staked tokens and rewards in case their address is blocklisted. This function should bypass the normal reward distribution mechanism and directly transfer the staked tokens and any available rewards back to the user.

- `Fallback Mechanism for Rewards`: Implement a fallback mechanism for reward distribution. If a USDC transfer fails due to blocklisting, the contract should have an alternative method to distribute rewards, such as using a different ERC20 token or holding the rewards in escrow until the issue is resolved.
