## Summary
If necessary, the values can be retrieved from the verified contract source code. Alternatively, if multiple values are involved, a single getter function can be implemented to return a tuple containing all the currently-public constants. This approach saves 3406-3606 gas during deployment because the compiler does not need to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, store the bytes of the values separately from their usage, or add another entry to the method ID table.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is more gas efficient to use private than public for constants.
## Impact
Some additional gas consumption occurs.

## Recommendation
Use private rather than public for constants, and save gas
