# Permanent loss of rewards for stakers due to precision loss

## Summary
The reward calculation due to insufficient wrapping before dividing by `rewardsDuration` leads to a loss of precision, especially over longer durations, which can result in significant losses for stakers.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StakingRewardsV2` contract facilitates distribution of rewards across the epoch duration. The calculation for reward rate is provided below: 
```solidity
 if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }
```
The rate is later multiplied by the duration to get the total rewards for elapsed time, demonstrated below:
```solidity
   function getRewardForDuration() external view returns (uint256) {
        return rewardRate * rewardsDuration;
    }
```
An issue occurs because there is no sufficient wrapping of the amount before dividing by `rewardsDuration`. The number is divided and later multiplied by elapsed time, causing a loss of precision of the amount modulo remaining time. For the provided period of `1 week` by the sponsor, the maximum amount lost can be calculated:`7 * 24 * 3600 - 1 = 604799`. Note that the average case loss is half of the worst case assuming even distribution across time. However since rewards are usually not sent at the low end of remaining time.

example:

-    Because we know duration is `604800` we can see that the `rewardRate` max loss is `604799`.

-    Meaning the potential max dust due to rounding down can be upwards of a number with 12 decimals

The effect of this size of loss depends on the decimals and value of the reward token. For USDC, this would be $0.6. The loss is shared between all stakers relative to their stake amount. The loss occurs for every notification, so it is clear losses will be severe.

## Impact
Stakers experience a permanent loss of rewards due to precision loss, which occurs every time rewards are distributed.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Store the `rewardRate` scaled by 1e18, so loss of precision will be lower by magnitude of 1e18.
