# `StakingRewardsV2.sol#compound()` function is incorrectly implemented

### Summary

## Summary

The `IStakingRewards.sol` interface specifies that the `compound()` function should "claim rewards for an account and stake them." However, the implementation of `compound()` in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract incorrectly stakes all of the escrowed tokens instead of the reward tokens that are escrowed to the `RewardEscrow` contract.

1. **`IStakingRewards.sol` Interface**:
   ```solidity
   function compound() external;
   ```

   The interface specifies that the `compound()` function should claim rewards and stake them.

2. **`StakingRewardsV2.sol` Implementation**:
   ```solidity
   function compound() external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
       uint256 escrowedAmount = escrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
       if (escrowedAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();
       _stake(msg.sender, escrowedAmount);
       emit Compounded(msg.sender, escrowedAmount);
   }
   ```

   The `compound()` function in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract incorrectly stakes all of the escrowed tokens instead of the reward tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `compound()` function is supposed to claim the rewards for an account and then stake those rewards. However, the current implementation stakes the entire escrowed balance of the user instead of just the reward tokens that should be claimed and then staked. This incorrect behavior can lead to unintended staking actions, affecting the users' expected staking and reward compounding process.

## Impact

1. **Incorrect Staking Behavior**:
   - Users' entire escrowed balance is staked instead of just the reward tokens, which can lead to significant discrepancies in their staking strategy and expected returns.

2. **Disruption of Reward Compounding**:
   - The intended purpose of compounding rewards is disrupted, as the function stakes more tokens than intended, leading to potential financial implications for users.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function compound() external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
    uint256 escrowedAmount = escrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (escrowedAmount == 0) revert AmountZero();
    _stake(msg.sender, escrowedAmount);
    emit Compounded(msg.sender, escrowedAmount);
}
```

## Recommendation

To resolve this issue, modify the `compound()` function to correctly claim the reward tokens and then stake them, rather than staking the entire escrowed balance.
