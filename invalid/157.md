# `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract may not work properly on Optimism due to use of `block.number`

### Summary

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract uses `block.number` within its `Checkpoint` struct, which can cause issues on the Optimism Layer 2 solution due to the differences in block number handling between Ethereum Layer 1 and Optimism.

1. The `Checkpoint` struct includes the `blk` property which stores `block.number`:

```solidity
struct Checkpoint {
    uint64 ts;
    uint64 blk;
    uint128 value;
}
```

2. The `block.number` is used when adding a new checkpoint:

```solidity
function _addCheckpoint(Checkpoint[] storage checkpoints, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 length = checkpoints.length;
    uint256 lastTimestamp;
    unchecked {
        lastTimestamp = length == 0 ? 0 : checkpoints[length - 1].ts;
    }

    if (lastTimestamp != block.timestamp) {
        checkpoints.push(
            Checkpoint({
                ts: uint64(block.timestamp),
                blk: uint64(block.number),
                value: uint128(_value)
            })
        );
    } else {
        unchecked {
            checkpoints[length - 1].value = uint128(_value);
        }
    }
}
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The use of `block.number` in the `Checkpoint` struct and related logic can cause inconsistencies on Optimism, where `block.number` does not increment in the same way as on Ethereum mainnet. This discrepancy can lead to inaccurate checkpoint data, affecting the contract’s functionality related to staking and reward calculations.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability includes:

1. Inaccurate checkpoint records, leading to potential discrepancies in user balances and rewards.
2. Unreliable reward calculations and distributions, causing potential financial loss or unfair reward allocations to users.

**I think this should be valid medium severity bug because the protocol devs [said this in the previous report](https://github.com/Kwenta/token/blob/main/audits/external/kwenta-staking-v2-second-migration-final-report.md#:~:text=%22We%20decided%20to%20keep%20the%C2%A0block.number%C2%A0in%20the%C2%A0Checkpoint%C2%A0struct%20in%20case%20we%20need%20it%20in%20the%20future.%20We%20have%20however%20used%20packing%20to%20reduce%20the%20gas%20impact%20of%20this.%22):**
**"We decided to keep the block.number in the Checkpoint struct in case we need it in the future. We have however used packing to reduce the gas impact of this."**

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _addCheckpoint(Checkpoint[] storage checkpoints, uint256 _value) internal {
    uint256 length = checkpoints.length;
    uint256 lastTimestamp;
    unchecked {
        lastTimestamp = length == 0 ? 0 : checkpoints[length - 1].ts;
    }

    if (lastTimestamp != block.timestamp) {
        checkpoints.push(
            Checkpoint({
                ts: uint64(block.timestamp),
                blk: uint64(block.number),
                value: uint128(_value)
            })
        );
    } else {
        unchecked {
            checkpoints[length - 1].value = uint128(_value);
        }
    }
}
```

## Recommendation

Just remove the use of `block.number` because the code already store the `block.timestamp` in the checkpoints mapping.
