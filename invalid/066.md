# `StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount` may fail transferring the rewards' supply to `StakingRewardsV2`

## Summary
`notifyRewardAmount` can send incorrect information to `StakingRewardsV2`, leading to failure to send rewards and inaccurate reward rate calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
As it is said in the ERC20 Standard (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20#methods) - "Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`. Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!", which is not done in `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol`:
```javascript
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
        uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
        kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance); // <@
        uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc); // <@

        stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
    }
```
If not, `stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` function will send false information causing a change in `rewardRate` and `rewardRateUSDC` without transferring the rewards to `StakingRewardsV2`. As a consequence, people won't be able to claim their accumulated rewards.

## Impact
Inability to distribute users' rewards
