# Precision loss and loss of funds

## Summary
In the `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount` there is a precision loss leading to 10% loss. This is due to the precision loss made in the calculation. Also there is no way to recover the KWENTA token due to the check in `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises due to the calculation done in `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount`. The reward rates both for KWENTA token and USDC token are done in a way that up to 10% can be lost from the reward amount.

## Impact
1. `StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount` is called and the current balance of the  kwenta token is 279.
2. `StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount` calls the `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount` and for the sake of the example the `rewardsDuration` is 20.
3. Also the current period is finished.
4. The code will compute that value of the `rewardRate` will be 13. And in the contract some KWENTA token amount will be stuck, in our scenario this will be 19.
5. This is almost 7% loss in the above example.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
	external
	onlyRewardsNotifier
	updateReward(address(0))
{
	if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
		rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
		rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
	} else {
		uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

		uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
		rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

		uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
		rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
	}

	lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
	periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
	emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Possible mitigation here is to transfer the amount that is left (stuck) to the owner or back to the notifier. Also what can be changed is that the owner could have the ability to recover the stuck KWENTA and USDC token amounts:

```diff
function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
-	if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
	emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
	IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
}
```
