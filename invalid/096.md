# Users cannot withdraw staked tokens through the unstake function

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L252-L271
In `StakingRewardsV2.sol:261-262` the incorrect use of the return value from `nonEscrowedBalanceOf `function as a validation for the amount during the unstake process might prevent users from successfully unstaking.

### Root Cause

In `StakingRewardsV2.sol:261`, when the result of `escrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender)` is not 0, the result returned by the `nonEscrowedBalanceOf` function is not the actual number of tokens staked by the user through the `stake` function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user stakes 100 kwenta through the `stake` function.
2. The user stakes 50 kwenta through the `stakeEscrow` function.
3. Then the user unstakes 60 kwenta through the `unstake` function.

### Impact

When the amount staked by a user through the `stakeEscrow` function is greater than 0, the user cannot withdraw all the tokens staked through the `stake` function through the `unstake` function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to repair it in the following way:

```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _amount)
    public
    whenNotPaused
    updateReward(msg.sender)
    afterCooldown(msg.sender)
{
    if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
    uint256 nonEscrowedBalance = balanceOf(msg.sender);//
    if (_amount > nonEscrowedBalance) revert InsufficientBalance(nonEscrowedBalance);

    // update state
    _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() - _amount);
    _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) - _amount);

    // emit unstake event and index msg.sender
    emit Unstaked(msg.sender, _amount);

    // transfer token from this contract to the caller
    kwenta.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```
