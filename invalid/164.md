# The calculation for `rewardRateUSDC` will be incorrect if set to zero.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `notifyRewardAmount()` function is called with a zero `_rewardUsdc` amount, and the first `if` condition passes, the code will execute `_rewardUsdc = 0 / rewardsDuration;` resulting in `_rewardUsdc` being set to zero. Consequently, all functions dependent on `_rewardUsdc` will yield incorrect values. For instance, the `rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC` function 
## Impact
The calculation for `rewardRateUSDC` appears to be incorrect.

## Recommendation
There should be an `if` condition that reverts the transaction if  `_rewardUsdc` is set to zero.
