# Reward Distribution Inconsistency Due to Dynamic Reward Duration Changes

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract allows the owner to change the `rewardsDuration` using the `setRewardsDuration` function. This change can be made immediately after a reward period ends, potentially leading to inconsistent reward distribution and creating opportunities for strategic claiming.

## Impact

 Changes in `rewardsDuration` directly affect the `rewardRate`, causing sudden increases or decreases in the rate of reward accrual.

1. Initial rewardsDuration is set to 1 week (604800 seconds)
2. A reward period ends
3. Owner calls setRewardsDuration(1209600) (2 weeks)
4. notifyRewardAmount is called with the same reward amount
5. The new rewardRate becomes half of its previous value
