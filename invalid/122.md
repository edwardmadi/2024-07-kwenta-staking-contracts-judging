# Cooldown Exploits in Staking Contracts: How Malicious Users/Active Operator Can Deny Withdrawal Access

## Summary

The staking contract has a vulnerability where the cooldown period for a user's balance can be unintentionally or intentionally extended by another approved user (User B), preventing the user (User A) from withdrawing their funds. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) situation for User A, as their withdrawal date can be perpetually extended.

Escrowed balance and Users Staked balance are tracked/Handled differently Using the same Time to track different activity(Staking Reward/Staking Kwenta) even though we are staking the same token can extend the cooldown period of the normal balance creating a vulnerability .

## Vulnerability Detail

When User A stakes tokens and earns rewards, they may approve a trusted entity (User B) to compound and stake rewards on their behalf. 
1.  User A has 10,000 tokens staked 
2. 3,000 tokens available for withdrawal, with a cooldown period of 2 weeks.
3. User B, intentionally or unintentionally, stakes rewards for User A on day 10 
4.  The cooldown period for User A's balance is extended by an additional 2 weeks (to Day 24). 
5. As a result, User A would need to wait until day 24 to withdraw their funds, 
6. assuming no further actions are taken within this period.

This mechanism can be exploited by User B, either unintentionally or intentionally, to extend User A's withdrawal date indefinitely. By repeatedly staking rewards, User B can ensure that User A is unable to withdraw their funds unless they unapprove all operators. 

NOTE----- Although User B may be performing their intended role of restaking rewards, this action extends the cooldown period and creates a DoS vulnerability for User A.

    }

        _addBalancesCheckpoint(_account, balanceOf(_account) + _amount);
        _addEscrowedBalancesCheckpoint(_account, escrowedBalanceOf(_account) + _amount);

        // updates total supply despite no new staking token being transfered.
        // escrowed tokens are locked in RewardEscrow
        _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);
```

                         function unstake(uint256 _amount)
                               public
                               whenNotPaused
                               updateReward(msg.sender)
@audit >> revert>>        afterCooldown(msg.sender)
    {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

 @audit >> unable to remove stake after 2weeks DOS >>         uint256 nonEscrowedBalance = nonEscrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
```


## Impact

A malicious or overly active approved user (User B) can exploit this vulnerability to extend the cooldown period for another user (User A), preventing them from withdrawing their funds when the want to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this DoS vulnerability, implement separate cooldown periods for the user's main balance and the escrowed rewards balance. This ensures that an approved contract or user cannot maliciously extend the cooldown period of the main balance by staking rewards.

```solidity
           // Add a separate cooldown period for escrowed balance
++    mapping(address => uint256) public userLastEscrowStakeTime;

function stake(uint256 _amount) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
    if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

    // update state
      userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);
    _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) + _amount);

    // emit staking event and index msg.sender
    emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);

    // transfer token to this contract from the caller
    kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}

function _stakeEscrow(address _account, uint256 _amount)
    internal
    whenNotPaused
    updateReward(_account)
{
    if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
    uint256 unstakedEscrow = unstakedEscrowedBalanceOf(_account);
    if (_amount > unstakedEscrow) revert InsufficientUnstakedEscrow(unstakedEscrow);

    // update state
--        userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
++     userLastEscrowStakeTime[_account] = block.timestamp;  // Separate cooldown for escrowed balance

    _addBalancesCheckpoint(_account, balanceOf(_account) + _amount);
    _addEscrowedBalancesCheckpoint(_account, escrowedBalanceOf(_account) + _amount);

    // updates total supply despite no new staking token being transferred.
    // escrowed tokens are locked in RewardEscrow
    _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);

    // emit escrow staking event and index account
    emit EscrowStaked(_account, _amount);
}
```
