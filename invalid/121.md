# Missing address check in `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20()`

### Summary

In `token\contracts\StakingRewardsV2.sol` the function `recoverERC20()` is used to retrieve tokens mistakenly sent to the contract.

This contract is aimed to receive `KWENTA` tokens but in this new version the contract will also hold `USDC`.

In order to mitigate potential rug pulls or such, Kwenta has implemented a verification to make sure `KWENTA` tokens can't be retrieved through this function.

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L711>

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
@>  if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
    // @audit-issue USDC can be recovered
    emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
    IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
}
```

### Root Cause

Since `USDC` will also be held by the contract, the function must implement a requirement to ensure the token that is being recovered from the contract is not `USDC` to mitigate rug pulls or such.

### Impact

Without this requirement, protocol admin (legitimate or not) is able to steal `UDSC` rewards owed to protocol users.

Adding this requirement will ensure the users' rewards remain safe and increase users trust.

### Mitigation

Simply add an additionnal check on `address(usdc)`

```diff
function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
+       if (_tokenAddress == address(usdc)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
```
