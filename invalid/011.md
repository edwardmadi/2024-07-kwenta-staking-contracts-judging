# Kwenta and USDC return values not checked

## Summary

The `ERC20.transfer()` and `ERC20.transferFrom()` functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `notifyRewardAmount()` function of the `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol` contract calculates the balances of Kwenta and USDC, and then transfers them to the `stakingRewardsV2`. The issue is that the return values of those transfers are not being checked, which might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring the return value will lead to considering it successful, and passing the variables to the `stakingRewardsV2` for further calculations, without actually doing a transfer:

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
        uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
        kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
        uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);

        stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
    }
```

## Impact

In the case mentioned tokens that don't perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer, so this flow will continue to go through and make the balances of the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` incorrect.

## Recommendation

Use [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.1/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L74) versions with the `safeTransfer()`. And this is actual for the `token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol` as well, as it is not using safe methods as well.
