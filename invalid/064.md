# `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20()` can be used as a backdoor by the `owner` to retrieve USDC rewards

## Summary
The `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20()` function allows the contract owner to recover ERC20 tokens sent to the contract, excluding the staking/reward token KWENTA. However, in the upgraded contract, USDC is also used as a reward token but is not included as a restricted ERC20 token in `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20()`. This oversight creates an opportunity for the owner to potentially use this function as a backdoor to retrieve USDC rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious/compromised owner can call `StakingRewardsV2::recoverERC20()` with `_tokenAddress` set to the USDC address to transfer the USDC tokens out of the contract.

## Impact
Users can lose all USDC rewards to a malicious/compromised owner.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a requirement that `_tokenAddress` can't be USDC:
```diff
    function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
-        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
+        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta) || _tokenAddress == address(usdc)) revert CannotRecoverStakingOrRewardToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
```
