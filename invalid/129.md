# Loss of user funds in `StakingRewardsV2`, User can unstake and not get any tokens in return

## Summary
Kwenta token transfers in `stakingRewardsV2:unstake` may silently fail, causing user state to be updated even when no tokens are received

## Vulnerability Detail
the transfer of Kwenta tokens to pay the user after unstaking can fail silently , the `stakingContractV2` is using  `transferFrom` function of the ERC20 interface instead of `safeTransferFrom` in most of the codebase. Moreover, the return value of this function is not checked. As not all ERC20 tokens revert on a failed transfer, this could lead to a silent failure of a transfer and loss of user funds

## Impact
 As not all ERC20 tokens revert on a failed transfer, this could lead to a silent failure of 
 the token transfer and subsequent loss of user funds.
As the function will go on in this case this could update state of `msg.sender` while they do not receive any Kwenta tokens and this will break core protocol functionality

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L248

```solidity
function stake(uint256 _amount) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        // update state
        userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp; 
        _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) + _amount);

        // emit staking event and index msg.sender
        emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);

        // transfer token to this contract from the caller
        kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount); //<-- @audit this should be safeTransferFrom or check for success
    }
```


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
check for (success) post transfer or use `safeTransferFrom` from openZeppelin to mitigate this and other possible edge case weirdERC20 vulnerabilities.
