# The owner can steal all the USDC rewards from the contract

### Summary

Since there's no exclusion for the USDC token in the `recoverERC20` function, the owner can steal all the USDC rewards from the contract through this function.

### Root Cause

In the `StakingRewardsV2.sol:710`, the owner can call the recoverERC20 function to recover other ERC20 tokens that were mistakenly sent to the contract. However, the function does not exclude the USDC token, which is one of the reward tokens in this project. This allows the admin to invoke the function to steal the USDC tokens intended for rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The owner calls the `recoverERC20` function and sets `_tokenAddress` to the address of the USDC token.

### Impact

This allows the admin to invoke the recoverERC20 function to steal all USDC tokens intended for rewards.

### Mitigation

It's suggested to include a check in the recoverERC20 function that verifies _tokenAddress is not equal to the address of the USDC token.
