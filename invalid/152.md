# Continuous Reward Accrual During Protocol Paused State Leads to Unfair Reward Distribution

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract allows users to continue accruing rewards even when the protocol is paused. This behavior could lead to unintended reward distribution and potential economic imbalances in the system.

## Vulnerability Details

The contract's pause mechanism, implemented through the PausableUpgradeable contract, stops new staking and unstaking actions but does not halt the accrual of rewards. This is because the reward calculation logic in `rewardPerToken()` and `rewardPerTokenUSDC()` functions continues to use the current timestamp, regardless of the contract's paused state.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to several issues:

1. Unfair reward distribution: Users who staked before the pause continue to accrue rewards, while new users cannot enter the system.
2. Economic imbalance: If the pause is extended, it could lead to an outsized reward distribution to a limited set of participants.
3. Front running opportunities: Users could exploit the pause to stake or unstake at advantageous times, knowing that rewards will continue to accrue.

## Code Snippet

## Proof Of Concept

Let's walk through a scenario with Alice to demonstrate this issue:

1. Alice stakes 1000 KWENTA tokens.
2. The reward rate is set to 1 KWENTA per second.
3. After 1 day (86400 seconds), the protocol is paused due to a discovered issue.
4. The pause lasts for the remaining 6 days of a 7-day period.

### Manual Calculation:

Initial stake: 1000 KWENTA = 1000 _ 10^18 (considering 18 decimal places)
Reward rate: 1 KWENTA per second = 1 _ 10^18 per second

#### Step 1: Rewards accrued before pause (1 day)

```javascript
Time before pause = 86400 seconds (1 day)
Rewards before pause = (Reward rate _ Time _ Stake) / Total stake
= (1 _ 10^18 _ 86400 _ 1000 _ 10^18) / (1000 _ 10^18)
= 86400 _ 10^18 KWENTA
```

#### Step 2: Rewards accrued during pause (6 days)

```javascript
Pause duration = 6 _ 86400 = 518400 seconds
Rewards during pause = (Reward rate _ Time _ Stake) / Total stake
= (1 _ 10^18 _ 518400 _ 1000 _ 10^18) / (1000 _ 10^18)
= 518400 \* 10^18 KWENTA
```

#### Step 3: Total rewards

```javascript
Total rewards = Rewards before pause + Rewards during pause
= (86400 _ 10^18) + (518400 _ 10^18)
= 604800 \* 10^18 KWENTA
```

#### Step 4: Convert to whole KWENTA tokens

```javascript
604800 \* 10^18 / 10^18 = 604800 KWENTA
```

This manual calculation shows that Alice would accrue 604,800 KWENTA tokens as rewards over the 7-day period. Notably, 518,400 KWENTA (85.7% of the total) were accrued during the 6-day pause period when no other actions could be taken on the contract.

This scenario highlights that:

1. Reward accrual continues uninterrupted even when the protocol is paused.
2. A significant portion of rewards (in this case, 85.7%) can be earned during the paused state.
3. Users who staked before the pause gain an unfair advantage, as they continue to earn rewards while new users cannot enter the system.

### Proof Of Code

Add the following code to the `StakingTestHelpers.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function pauseStakingRewarsV2() internal {
        vm.prank(stakingRewardsV2.owner());
        stakingRewardsV2.pauseStakingRewards();
    }

    function unpauseStakingRewarsV2() internal {
        vm.prank(stakingRewardsV2.owner());
        stakingRewardsV2.unpauseStakingRewards();
    }
```

Place the following code into the `StakingV2RewardCalculations.t.sol` file:

```javascript
function test_Bluedragon_WhenPaused_RewardsStill_Accures() public {
        uint256 lengthOfPeriod = 1 weeks;
        uint256 initialStake = 1000 ether;

        // send in 604800 (1 week) of rewards - (using 1 week for round numbers)
        addNewRewardsToStakingRewardsV2(1 weeks, 0);

        // Alice stakes 1000 KWENTA
        fundAccountAndStakeV2(user1, initialStake);

        // protocol is paused after 1 day of the reward period
        vm.warp(1 days);

        // pause the contract
        pauseStakingRewarsV2();

        // fast forward 1 week - one complete period
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + lengthOfPeriod + 1 days);

        // unpause the contract
        unpauseStakingRewarsV2();

        // Alice calls get reward function
        getStakingRewardsV2(user1);

        uint256 firstRewards = rewardEscrowV2.escrowedBalanceOf(user1);
        console.log("Rewards distributed to alice in first cycle: ", firstRewards, "KWENTA");
    }
```

Here's the output of the test:

```javascript
Ran 1 test for test/foundry/unit/StakingRewardsV2/StakingV2RewardCalculations.t.sol:StakingV2RewardCalculationTests
[PASS] test_Bluedragon_WhenPaused_RewardsStill_Accures() (gas: 597666)
Logs:
  Rewards distributed to alice in first cycle:  604000 KWENTA

Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 23.41ms (2.94ms CPU time)
```

## Recommendations

1. Modify the `rewardPerToken()` and `rewardPerTokenUSDC()` functions to consider the paused state:

```diff
function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
+    if (paused()) {
+        return rewardPerTokenStored;
+    }

    uint256 allTokensStaked = totalSupply();
    if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
        return rewardPerTokenStored;
    }

    return rewardPerTokenStored +
        (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
}
```

2. Implement a similar change for `rewardPerTokenUSDC()`.

3. Update the `_updateReward()` function to not update `lastUpdateTime` when paused:

```diff
function _updateReward(address _account) internal {
    rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
    rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC = rewardPerTokenUSDC();
+    if (!paused()) {
+        lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
    }

    // ... rest of the function remains the same
}
```

4. Consider implementing a mechanism to adjust the `periodFinish` when unpausing the contract, to account for the paused duration.

By implementing these changes, the contract will ensure that rewards are not accrued during paused periods, maintaining fairness and preventing potential economic exploits.
