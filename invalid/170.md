# Users may need to wait for longer than expected to get their rewards

## Summary
Users may need to wait for longer than expected to get their rewards due to notifyRewardAmount() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
notifyRewardAmount() allows the RewardsNotifier contract to set new rewards for Kwenta and USDC tokens. If this function is called before the current period has finished, then the tokens that normally would have been disitributed along the period are added to the rewards of new period and a new rewardRate is established.

If the new rewardsDuration is greater and the new rewards set by RewardsNotifier is lower, then users will receive less tokens than expected in the same period of time, as a result of a lower rewardRate value resulting.

## Impact
Users may experiment a delay in getting their expected reward.

## Recommendation
Recommendation to avoid this unexpected behaviour for the users is to prevent the function from being called if current period has not finished yet:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
-      } else {
-            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
-
-           uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
-          rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
-
-           uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
-          rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
-     }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```
