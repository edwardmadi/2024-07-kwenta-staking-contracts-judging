# Some amount of rewards can be stuck in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract when `totalSupply=0`

## Summary
If for some period `totalSupply()` was `0` then contract won't increase `rewardPerTokenStored` and rewards for those periods would be stuck in contract forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
This is [rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L435-L444) code in `StakingRewardsV2.sol` :
```js
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 allTokensStaked = totalSupply();


        if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }


        return rewardPerTokenStored
            + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
    }
```
When the `totalSupply()` is 0, there is 0 `rewardPerToken()` increment as there is no supply to factor the rewards by.

The current solution is to maintain the same `rewardsPerToken()` if the `totalSupply()` is 0, but the `lastUpdateTime` is still updated.
```js
 if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
```
This means that, if for some period `totalSupply()` was 0 then contract won't increase `rewardPerTokenStored` and those periods' rewards would be stuck in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol`contract forever, because there is no mechanism to calculate and withdraw them in the contract.
```js
    function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
@>      if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
```
This situation always happen if the rewards are notified before the `totalSupply()` is bigger than 0. It might also happen if users withdraw all their tokens from the contract, leading to a `totalSupply()` of 0, but this is very unlikely.

## Impact
Rewards can be stuck in the contract forever in case of `totalSupply` being 0

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to track and distribute rewards during zero-supply periods.
