# To keep their liquid KWENTA unlocked while compounding, sophisticated users can transfer their RewardEscrowV2 NFTs to another address and `stakeEscrow` from it

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

By design, after the cooldown is over, users continue receiving staking rewards, while being able to unstake their liquid KWENTA at any time. But if they want to get more rewards, they can stake their escrowed KWENTA, which would update their cooldown, which in turn would make their initially staked KWENTA unwithdrawable until the new cooldown is over.

However, it is possible to circumvent the new cooldown for the initial stake: 

Once the initial cooldown is over, users can keep their liquid KWENTA always withdrawable, by transferring their RewardEscrowV2 NFTs to another address and calling `stakeEscrow` from that second address.

### Proof of Concept 

1. Alice claims rewards and wants to stake her escrowed KWENTA, so she uses `stakeEscrow` (or `compound`), which updates her `userLastStakeTime`. If she decides to unstake her liquid KWENTA, she would be able to do so only after the new cooldown is over.

2. Bob claims rewards and transfers his RewardEscrowV2 NFT to another address that belongs to him, and `stakesEscrow` from that second address, so his first account's `userLastStakeTime` remains unchanged. This way, Bob will be able to unstake liquid KWENTA to his first account at any time, while compounding his escrowed KWENTA and receiving the same rewards as Alice until he withdraws.


## Impact

Sophisticated users who regularly compound their KWENTA are able to unstake their liquid KWENTA at any time, while others have to wait until their latest cooldown is over. Hence, they are **taking a lower risk for the same reward**.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In order to give all users equal opportunity regardless of their solidity competence, either:

1. stakeEscrow should not increase `userLastStakeTime`
2. or liquid KWENTA should have a separate cooldown tracking
3. or RewardEscrowV2 NFTs should be untransferrable
