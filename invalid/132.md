# `stakeEscrow` can dilute tokens rewards

## Summary
`stakeEscrow` compound can dilute rewards for those who do not want to stake escrow 

## Vulnerability Detail
If two users stake the same amount of tokens and then claim rewards, their rewards are vested in to rewardEscrow contract. Users can compound rewards by staking rewards by calling `stakeEscrow`. This function should allow users to earn more by staking rewards, but in fact, it also dilutes rewards for those who do not want to restake reward tokens.  It happens because `stakeEscrow` increases total supply and thus decreases reward per one token. 
It is fair for the usual staking flow if users stake more, rewards per token decrease. But in case of `stakeEscrow` users are not transferring actual kwenta tokens, they just call escrow balance inside the contract

## Impact
stake escrow can dilute the tokens reward
