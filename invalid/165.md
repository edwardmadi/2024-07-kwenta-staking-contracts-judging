# `StakingRewardsV2:RecoverERC20` can revert when called and funds stuck in staking contract can be lost forever.

## Summary
Funds stuck in contract can be lost forever if renounceOwnership is ever called, Override `RenounceOwnership` to revert when called when using ownable2step.
Ownable2Step inherits from Ownable and overrides "transferOwnership()" to make the new owner "pending." The receiver must then call "acceptOwnership()" to finalize the transfer. This ensures only an address that has access to it's private keys, or control of the smart contract address, can control the smart contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Ownable2Step is used here`

There is still no two-step verification for renouncing ownership, i.e. transferring ownership to the zero address. If there is no need to renounce ownership, then it is safer to override "renounceOwnership()" to revert when called.

## Impact
Funds stuck in the staking contract can be lost forever if ownership of contract is erroneously renounced which is the reason for using `ownable2Step` in the first place to make sure that  only an address that has access to it's private keys, or control of the smart contract address, can control the smart contract.

The `renounceOwnership` function from openZeppelin

``` solidity 
function renounceOwnership() public virtual onlyOwner {
        _transferOwnership(address(0));
    }
```

## Code Snippet
RecoverERC20 will fail when called if contract ownership is ever renounced.

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
```
