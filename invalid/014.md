# Unauthorized Initialization Leading to Contract Takeover

## Summary
The `initialize` function in the `StakingRewardsV2` can be front-run by an attacker, allowing them to take control of the contract by setting themselves as the owner. This vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access, manipulation of funds, and operational disruption.

## Vulnerability Detail
1.	Deployment Phase:
-	The contract is deployed, but the `initialize` function has not yet been called.
2.	Attacker Monitoring:
-	An attacker monitors the blockchain for new deployments of this contract.
3.	Front-Running Attack:
-	Upon detecting the deployment, the attacker quickly calls the `initialize` function before the legitimate owner.
-	The attacker sets their own address as the `_contractOwner`.

## Impact
-	Ownership Control: 
o	The attacker gains ownership of the contract.
o	They can perform privileged actions like pausing the contract, upgrading the implementation, or setting reward parameters.
-	Funds Manipulation: 
o	The attacker can manipulate staking and unstaking processes.
o	They can potentially drain funds or disrupt the reward distribution.
-	Forced Redeployment: 
o	In the best-case scenario, the legitimate owner must redeploy the contract, incurring additional costs and delays.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add an access control mechanism to ensure only authorized addresses can call the initialize function.
```solidity
address private initializer;

constructor(address _initializer) {
    initializer = _initializer;
}

function initialize(address _contractOwner) external initializer {
    require(msg.sender == initializer, "Not authorized");
    __Ownable2Step_init();
    __Pausable_init();
    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    ...
}
```
- Use a two-step initialization process where the contract is deployed in a paused state, and only the deployer can unpause it after initialization.
