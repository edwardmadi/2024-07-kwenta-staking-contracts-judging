# `StakingRewardsV2::_getReward` function can be blocked for users blacklisted  by USDC

## Summary
Users cannot harvest Kwenta rewards if blacklisted by USDC

## Vulnerability Detail
USDC can blacklist any user. Imagine if the user has rewards in Kwenta and USDC tokens. Then the user gets blacklisted by USDC. It should not influence the user's ability to claim Kwenta rewards from the staking contract.  But it does. If USDC blacklists a user, `_getReward` will always revert if the same user has USDC in rewards. This line will revert:
```solidity
usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
```
So user cannot claim Kwenta tokens using this function

## Impact
This can lead to DOS issue, and block users from claiming kwenta tokens

Make separate function to claim rewards for Kwenta tokens and for USDC tokens
