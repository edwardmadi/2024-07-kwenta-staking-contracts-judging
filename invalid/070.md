# The `StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` doesn't have `whenNotPaused` modifier

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract inherits `PausableUpgradeable` contract to pause the staking and reward distributing.
But, the `StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` function doesn't have `whenNotPaused` modifier.
As a result, even though the `owner` pauses the `StakingRewardsV2` contract, reward tokens are cumulated to this contract and `rewardRate` is increased.
If the `owner` unpauses the contract, the stakers can get rewards cumulated for paused duration.

## Vulnerability Detail

Everyone can call the `StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` function by calling `SupplySchedule.mint` function.
Because the `StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` doesn't have `whenNotPaused` modifier, calling this function is still available in case of the `StakingRewardsV2` contract is paused.
So, reward tokens are still cumulated to this contract and `rewardRate` is increased.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward);
    }
```

The stakers' reward amount is calculated using `rewardRate`.
As a result, if the `owner` unpauses the contract, the stakers can get rewards cumulated for paused duration.

## Impact

The `owner` can not pause the reward distribution correctly.
