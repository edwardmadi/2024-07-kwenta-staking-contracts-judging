# ERC20 return values not checked

### Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2.recoverERC20` function does not check the return value of this function.

### Root Cause

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead.

In `StakingRewardsV2.sol:713` there is missing a check on the return value of this function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Tokens that don't actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer. Furthermore, tokens that do not correctly implement the EIP20 standard, like USDT which does not return a success boolean, will revert.

### Mitigation

We recommend using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.
