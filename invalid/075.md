# Owner can change cooldown period anytime leading to impact on existing stakers

### Summary

The cooldown period is a dynamic field. If the owner changes the cooldown period it impacts all the existing stakers. As the increase in cooldown period will lead to stakers having to wait longer than what they initially saw while staking.

### Attack Path

1. Alice stakes **KWENTA** will cooldown period of 2 weeks.
2. Owner changes the cooldown period to 4 weeks.
3. Now, Alice will have to wait for additional 2 weeks even though at staking only 2 weeks of cooldown period was mentioned.

### Impact

It breaks the trust of users on the protocol as the owner can change the cooldown period anytime in between the existing cooldown period and the stakers will have no choice but to wait for longer even if they didn't sign up for it.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Instead of having a global variable there can be a mapping which returns the cooldown period of each staker. So the new cooldown period will be only applicable to new stakers and not on the existing ones.
