# Some tokens can be stuck in the protocol, due to rounding error

## Summary
TODO
## Vulnerability Detail
TODO
## Impact
Function `notifyRewardAmount` calculates `rewardRate`  by dividing `reward` amount by `duration` but because of the rounding error in division, some of reward amount wouldn't get distributed and stuck in contract and contract don't redistributes them or don't have any mechanism to recover them. This bug can be more damaging if the precision of `rewardToken` is low or token price is high.

## Code Snippet
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L651-L652
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
@>>         rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
@>>         rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
@>>         rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
@>>         rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```
## POC
```solidity
    function testRewardsRounding() public {
        uint256 lengthOfPeriod = stakingRewardsV2.rewardsDuration();
        uint256 initialStake = 1 ether;
        uint end = block.timestamp + lengthOfPeriod;

        fundAccountAndStakeV2(user1, initialStake);
        addNewRewardsToStakingRewardsV2(2 weeks - 1, 2 weeks - 1);

        assertEq(stakingRewardsV2.rewardRate(), 1);
    }
```

## Recommendation
This can  be solved by adding precision and by finding a way to reuse stuck rewards.
