# `rewardsDuration` should have a MIN and MAX range to prevent extreme values

## Summary
The current implementation of `StakingRewardsV2::setRewardsDuration()` function allows that the `rewardsDuration` can be set to a very low or high amount by the owner, which can lead to significant issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
The owner can maliciously or by **mistake** set `rewardsDuration` to a very low value (as low as `1 second`) or a high value (up to `type(uint256).max/exceeding the age of the universe`) in the `StakingRewardsV2::setRewardsDuration()` function. 

## Impact
When `rewardsDuration` is changed to a extreme value(low or high) by the owner maliciously or by **mistake** and it isn't corrected before the new reward cycle, then potential scenarios can be: 
- Low value(e.g., 1 second): all rewards of the new reward cycle will be distributed in 1 second, this creates a opportunity for a maliciously or compromised owner to quickly withdraw the rewards, potentially giving them an unfair advantage based on their staking position at that time.
- High value(e.g., many years or up to type(uint256).max): the `rewardRate` will be so diluted that it will be near zero or `zero` due precision loss, causing the rewards to be lost within the contract. Additionally, this issue could not be easily corrected because the reward period must be finished before `rewardsDuration` can be adjusted back to a normal value. If `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount()` is called before the reward period ends, additional tokens would be lost inside the contract and `periodFinish` resets. All of this making the reward mechanism/protocol insolvent and resulting in tokens being lost.

Likelihood: low + Impact: high = Severity: medium

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a MIN and MAX range:
```diff
+   uint256 public constant MIN_REWARDS_DURATION = 4 days; // Example 
+   uint256 public constant MAX_REWARDS_DURATION = 52 weeks; // Example 

    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
-        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();
+        if (_rewardsDuration < MIN_REWARDS_DURATION) revert RewardsDurationTooLow(MIN_REWARDS_DURATION);
+        if (_rewardsDuration > MAX_REWARDS_DURATION) revert RewardsDurationTooHigh(MAX_REWARDS_DURATION);

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
