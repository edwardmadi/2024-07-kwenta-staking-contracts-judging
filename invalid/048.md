# `setRewardsDuration` DoS in certain conditions.

## Summary
`setRewardsDuration` does not have any MAX_VALUE checks such as `setCooldownPeriod`. If the `rewardDuration` is set to a value of 8 days or higher, malicious user can DoS it.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to invoke `setRewardsDuration`, the current period of rewards distribution must have finished.
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        **some code**
    }
```
Each invoke of `notifyRewardAmount` increases [`periodFinish`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L664) further, meaning that if a user is able to invoke the method continuosly, `setRewardsDistribution` would be uncallable. The flow of invoking `StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount` starts from `SupplySchedule.mint` whose call is restricted by `SupplySchedule.isMintable`

```solidity
    function isMintable() override public view returns (bool) {
        return block.timestamp - lastMintEvent > MINT_PERIOD_DURATION;
    }
```

`lastMintEvent` is recorded in `recordMintEvent` and is equal to weekCounter * 1 weeks + 1 days

```solidity
    function recordMintEvent(uint supplyMinted) internal returns (bool) {
        uint numberOfWeeksIssued = weeksSinceLastIssuance();


        // add number of weeks minted to weekCounter
        weekCounter = weekCounter + numberOfWeeksIssued;


        // Update mint event to latest week issued (start date + number of weeks issued * seconds in week)
        // 1 day time buffer is added so inflation is minted after feePeriod closes
        lastMintEvent = inflationStartDate + (weekCounter * MINT_PERIOD_DURATION) + MINT_BUFFER;


        emit SupplyMinted(supplyMinted, numberOfWeeksIssued, lastMintEvent);
        return true;
    }
```
Imagine the following scenario:
Contract is deployed, assume initialization timestamp = 0 (for simplicity purposes)
1 weeks + 1 passes, first `mint` is invoked
isMintable = true, since block.timestamp(604801) - lastMintEvent(0) > MINT_PERIOD_DURATION(604800)
`recordMintEvent` is invoked, lastMintEvent = 0 + (1 * 604_800) + 86_400 = 691_200
next time `isMintable` would be true is at block.timestamp >= 691_200 + 604_800 + 1 = 1_296_001 
`mint` logic continues, invokes `notifyRewardAmount` for the first time and sets periodFinish = 604_801 + rewardsDuration  
```solidity
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
```

In case where `rewardsDuration` was set by admin to e.g 10 days, `periodFinish` would equal = 604_801 + 10 * 86_400 = 1_468_801 while `mint` will be callable at 1_296_001. `mint` being available to call at an earlier timestamp is an issue as it always extends `periodFinish` further. A malicious user can exploit this by invoking `mint` as soon as it is available to further extend `periodFinish`, making `setRewardsDuration` uncallable. Setting the rewardsDuration to any value above 8 days + 1 opens the opportunity for `setRewardsDuration` DoS. 
## Impact
DoS of admin function
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();


        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
2 solutions are possible:
1. Forbid setting `rewardsDuration` to a value higher than 7 days
2. Make the MINT_BUFFER based on most recent rewardsDuration so that `mint` will be only callable at a timestamp later than `periodFinish`
