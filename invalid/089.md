# USDC Staking Rewards will be freezed when There Are No Stakers

### Summary

Rewards are irretrievably lost in the `StakingRewardsV2` contract if there are no active stakers, with no current method to recover these funds.

### Root Cause

* Initially, after deployment, when there are no stakers and no rewards, notifying new rewards via `notifyRewardAmount()` does not account for the new rewards in `rewardPerTokenStored` or `rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC`. However, [lastUpdateTime](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L413) is updated during staking, which leads to the freezing of these funds.

* There is no recovery mechanism to rescue the stucked USDC rewards in `recoverERC20` function which means reward will be stuck indefinitely in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

`StakingRewardsNotifier` notifies new rewards when there are no stakers, or all stakers unstake during an existing reward duration.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. New rewards are notified via the `notifyRewardAmount()` call.

2. It sets `rewardRate` and `rewardRateUSDC` to split the total pending rewards uniformly over the next `rewardsDuration`. `periodFinish` is set to `now + rewardsDuration`, while `lastUpdateTime = now`.

3. Suppose there are no stakers when the first rewards are sent, because of zero rewards at that time. If a staker joins later, the `updateReward` modifier is triggered, which calls `_updateReward`:

```solidity

    function _updateReward(address _account) internal {
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
1->     rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC = rewardPerTokenUSDC();
2->     lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();

```

here in first line, `rewardPerTokenUSDC` is calculated as:

```solidity

    /// @inheritdoc IStakingRewardsV2
    function rewardPerTokenUSDC() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 allTokensStaked = totalSupply();

@->     if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC;
        }

        return rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC
            + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRateUSDC * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
    }


```

4. In case `allTokensStaked` is zero, it returns the original `rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC` without accounting for the new rewards (Same for `rewardPerToken`).

5. The second line updates `lastUpdateTime`:

```solidity

    /// @inheritdoc IStakingRewardsV2
    function lastTimeRewardApplicable() public view returns (uint256) {
        return block.timestamp < periodFinish ? block.timestamp : periodFinish;
    }


```

6. Note that it would update regardless if `allTokensStaked==0` or not. Therefore, it would store the current timestamp in `lastUpdateTime`.

7. At this point, the tokens weren't distributed, but `lastUpdateTime` is updated. So in the future, the accumulation of tokens in `rewardPerToken()` or `rewardPerTokenUSDC()` will never include the days when there weren't any stakers.

8. This results in loss of rewards which are permanently stuck in the contract, whenver there are no stakers. That could be at any part of the contract's lifetime.

9. Additionally, `recoverERC20` does not allow the recovery of USDC, making the loss permanent.

### Impact

Permanent freeze of Rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Easiest mitigation is to Implement the recovery mechanism to rescue the USDC in such events.
