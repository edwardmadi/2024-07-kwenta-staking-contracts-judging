# The staking reward tokens may be permanently locked in the contract.

## Summary
If everyone withdraws from staking during the reward duration phase, but the reward clock for staking is still running, so the staking reward token will be permanently locked in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
If allTokensStaked drops to 0 during the staking reward period, the reward calculation will not temporarily stop but will continue to deplete, resulting in some rewards being locked in the contract.
POC:
The staking reward is 10000, and during the middle 1/3 of the time, allTokensStaked drops to 0. It can be seen that 1/3 of the staking reward is permanently stuck in the contract
```solidity
    function test_3() public {
        uint256 rewardsDurantion = stakingRewardsV2.rewardsDuration();

        console2.log(rewardsDurantion);
        address Alice = makeAddr("Alice");
        address Bob = makeAddr("Bob");

        fundAndApproveAccountV2(Alice, 3 ether);
        fundAndApproveAccountV2(Bob, 3 ether);

        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        stakingRewardsV2.stake(3 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 4 weeks);

        deal(address(kwenta), address(rewardsNotifier), 10000e18);
        vm.startPrank(address(supplySchedule));
        rewardsNotifier.notifyRewardAmount(1000);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + rewardsDurantion / 3);
        vm.startPrank(Alice);
        stakingRewardsV2.exit();
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + rewardsDurantion / 3);
        vm.startPrank(Bob);
        stakingRewardsV2.stake(3 ether);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 4 weeks);
        vm.startPrank(Bob);
        stakingRewardsV2.exit();
        vm.stopPrank();

        console2.log(
            "contract kwenta balance: %s",
            kwenta.balanceOf(address(stakingRewardsV2))
        );
    }
```

```solidity
    function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 allTokensStaked = totalSupply();

        if (allTokensStaked == 0) {
            return rewardPerTokenStored;
        }

        return rewardPerTokenStored
            + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When allTokensStaked becomes 0, pause the clock until it is restored after someone has staked it
```solidity
+  uint timeRemain;
    /// @notice update reward state for the account and contract
    /// @param _account: address of account which rewards are being updated for
    /// @dev contract state not specific to an account will be updated also
    modifier updateReward(address _account) {
        _updateReward(_account);
        _;
+        if ( totalSupply() == 0 && periodFinish > block.timestamp){
+          timeRemain = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
+        }
+        if ( totalSupply() != 0 && timeRemain != 0 ){
+           periodFinish = block.timestamp + timeRemain
+           timeRemain = 0;
+        }
    }

```
