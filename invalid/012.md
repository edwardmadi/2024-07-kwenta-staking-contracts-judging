# Apply nonReentrant Modifier

## Summary
The `StakingRewardsV2` contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack in its unstake function. This allows a malicious user to recursively call the `unstake` function, draining more tokens than they originally staked, leading to potential loss of funds for other users and the contract itself.

## Vulnerability Detail
1.	User Stakes Tokens:
-	The user stakes 100 KWENTA tokens.
-	`userLastStakeTime[msg.sender]` is set to the current timestamp.
-	`totalSupply` and `balancesCheckpoints[msg.sender]` are updated to reflect the staked amount.
2.	Malicious Contract Setup:
```solidity
contract MaliciousContract {
    StakingRewardsV2 public stakingContract;

    constructor(address _stakingContract) {
        stakingContract = StakingRewardsV2(_stakingContract);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        // Re-enter the unstake function
        stakingContract.unstake(10);
    }

    function attack() external {
        // Initial call to unstake
        stakingContract.unstake(10);
    }
}
```
3.	 Triggering the Attack:
-	The malicious user calls `attack` on `MaliciousContract`.
-	`MaliciousContract` calls `unstake(10)` on `StakingRewardsV2`.
4.	First Call to Unstake:
-	`StakingRewardsV2.unstake(10)` starts executing.
-	Checks pass (e.g., `afterCooldown`, `nonEscrowedBalance`).
-	The contract transfers 10 KWENTA tokens to `MaliciousContract`.
5.	Reentrancy Triggered:
-	The `fallback` function in `MaliciousContract` is triggered upon receiving the 10 KWENTA tokens.
-	The `fallback` function calls `StakingRewardsV2.unstake(10)` again before the first call completes.
6.	Second Call to Unstake:
-	The second call to `StakingRewardsV2.unstake(10)` starts executing.
-	Since the contract's state has not been updated yet, the checks pass again.
-	The contract transfers another 10 KWENTA tokens to `MaliciousContract`.
7.	Recursive Calls:
-	This process repeats, with each call to `unstake` triggering another call via the `fallback` function.
-	The malicious user can drain more tokens than they originally staked.
8.	State Inconsistency:
-	The contract's state becomes inconsistent, with the user's balance and the total supply not accurately reflecting the actual amounts.
-	Other users and the contract itself may suffer losses due to the drained tokens.


## Impact
- Token Drain
- State Inconsistency
- User Losses
- Contract Depletion
