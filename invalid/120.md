# There is no check to ensure timestamp wont be equal to block.timestamp

## Summary
As mentioned in the comments by dev if the func is called with a timestamp that equals the current block timestamp, then the function might return inconsistent values as further transactions changing the balances can still occur within the same block but still there isnt  a check to stop that...
## Vulnerability Detail
Example Scenario:
Initial State:

Assume the contract has checkpoints at various timestamps, and the function is called with a timestamp equal to block.timestamp.
Transaction A:

Transaction A updates the checkpoints at block.timestamp.
Transaction B (in the same block):

Transaction B calls _checkpointBinarySearch with block.timestamp.
_checkpointBinarySearch begins execution and reads the checkpoint values as they were after Transaction A.
Transaction C (still in the same block):

Transaction C also updates the checkpoints at block.timestamp.
Final Result:

The result returned by _checkpointBinarySearch in Transaction B might not include the updates made by Transaction C, leading to an inconsistent value.

## Impact
It can lead to inconsistent values.

## Recommendation
Write a check to ensure _timestamp cant be equal to block.timestamp
