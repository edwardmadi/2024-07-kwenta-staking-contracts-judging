# Wrong decimal assumption when calculating USDC rewards

### Summary 
Usage of  wrong precision when calculating USDC rewards 

### Vulnerability Detail
USDC has 6 decimals [https://optimistic.etherscan.io/token/0x0b2c639c533813f4aa9d7837caf62653d097ff85#readProxyContract#F11](url) on major EVM chains including optimism(where project will be deployed) but it is calculated with the precision of an 18 token decimals in several instances which will be highlighted in the code snippets posted below.

### Impact
This can lead to paying incorrect amount of USDC rewards and other unintended behaviors.

### Tool used
Manual Review 

### Reccommendation
Since the project integrates just two tokens no need for decimal conversion, consider changing all USDC related fucntions where 1e18 is used to 1e6
