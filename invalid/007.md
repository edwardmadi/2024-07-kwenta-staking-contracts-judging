# Anyone can be an operator (Access control problem)

## Summary

Lack of proper Access Control in 'approveOperator()' leads to anyone to be an operator.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function 'approveOperator()', there is no check that the 'msg.sender' is the owner or admin (i.e.) which leads to anyone can call the function (since it is 'external') and pass the '_operator' parameter anything that he/she wants.

    function approveOperator(address _operator, bool _approved) external {
        if (_operator == msg.sender) revert CannotApproveSelf();


        operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] = _approved;


        emit OperatorApproved(msg.sender, _operator, _approved);
    }

let's consider this example :
1 - Bob has two accounts or two addresses.
2 - Bob can call the function 'approveOperator()' by his first account and pass the '_operator' parameter by his second account address.
3 - The first check can be bypassed and Bob has successfully approved his second account and now his second account is an operator.

## Impact

1 - The operator role becomes redundant since anyone can be an operator.
2 - Access to the functions that have onlyOperator restrictions.

## Recommendation

It's better to add more restriction on 'approveOperator()' function, for example only owner can call this function.
