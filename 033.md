# Use safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom consistently instead of transfer/transferFrom

### Summary

It is compulsory  to add a require() statement that checks the return value of token transfers or to use something like OpenZeppelinâ€™s safeTransfer/safeTransferFrom for following token transfers,

Failure to do so will cause silent failures of transfers and affect token accounting in contract.If this happens in stake function then stakingrewardsV2 contract will have less amount of tokens than they should be.If this happens in unstake function then users will not get there tokens back but in contract's accounting it will be accounted as they took their tokens.

### Root Cause

 using safeTransfer or safeTransferFrom instead of transfer or transferFrom (or) not checking return values from transfer or transferFrom.USDC will revert the transaction but kwenta token will not revert, it will return false boolean on failure.In general it is recommended to use safeTransfer, safeTransferFrom or check return values and revert if transfer fails.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

stake, unstake,recoverERC20,_getReward functions will not revert even if token transfer fails. This is a serious issue as users can lose funds  and wrong accounting takes place in StakingRewardsV2 contract 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

use safeTransfer, safeTransferFrom instead of transer, transferFrom (or) add the following check,
1)
`(bool success) = kwenta.transfer(address(rewardEscrow), reward);`
`require(success,"kwenta token transfer failed");`
2)
`(bool success) = usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);`
`require(success,"usdc token transfer failed");`
3) 
`(bool success) = IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);`
`require(success,"token transfer failed");`
