# Users will not get reward at PeriodFinish due to modified rewardRate in `notifyRewardAmount`

### Summary

The legacy synthetix contract which the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract is modelled after has checks to ensure that the users can still earn rewards in the face of a modified rewardRate which is essentially what `notifyRewardsAmount` does. This contract however does not. 
if the rewards in the contract are insufficient for user payouts the function will still update the rewards meaning some users might not get rewards at `PeriodFinish`

in `stakingRewardsV2.sol:notifyRewardRAte`
`If (rewardRate * duration <= rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this)) revert returnAnError`

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L645

The root cause of the issue is insufficient checks that allow the contractOwner to set an incompatible rewardRate which may be insufficient depending on the amount of rewardTokens in the contract at the time of the modification


### Mitigation

Ensure that there are enough rewardTokens in the contract to pay users after `notifyRewardRate` is called
a require statement or a conditional will suffice

```require(rewardRate * duration <= rewardsToken.balanceOf(address(this)), "rewardAmount is greater than balance);```
