# Users not able to  `unstake` or `unstakeEscrow` even after the `cooldownPeriod`

## Summary
Users unable to unstake due to the wrong calculation of checking that coolDownPeriod has finished in afterCoolDown function
## Vulnerability Detail
`userLastStakeTime` mapping tracks the last time staked for a given user, and is updated at two occasions in the contract, firstly in `stake` function and secondly in `_stakeEscrow` function. this staked time is used to calculate the `afterCoolDown` modifier by adding in it the `finishPeriod`, which is used in functions `unstake` and `unstakeEscrow`, so users will not be able to unstake even after the coolDownPeriod if they first `stake`  or `_stakeEscrow` an amount and then after some time before coolDownPeriod they `_stakeEscrow` or `stake` more, it will increase the coolDownPeriod so users wont be able `untsake` or `unstakeEscrow` the first staked amount after the orignal coolDownPeriod ends. if this contiues, user wont be able to `unstake` or `unstakeEscrow` subsequent `_stakeEscrow` or `stake` amounts
## Impact
Users wont be able to unstake after the orignal coolDownPeriod ends.

## Proof of Concept
```javascript
function testUserUnableToUnStake() public {
    fundAndApproveAccountV2(address(this), TEST_VALUE);

    //user stakes 
    stakeFundsV2(address(this), TEST_VALUE/4);

    //week goes by
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    //after the week user stake Escrowed funds
    stakeEscrowedFundsV2(address(this), TEST_VALUE/4);

    //five days go by
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 5 days);

    //after five days user stakes Eswroed funds again
    stakeEscrowedFundsV2(address(this), TEST_VALUE/4);

    //week goes by
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 weeks);

    //even well after the 2 week coolDownPeriod user wont be able to unstake their firstly staked funds
    vm.expectRevert();
    unstakeFundsV2(address(this), TEST_VALUE/4);
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the time stamp stored in `Checkpoint.ts` to calculate the `afterCoolDown` time and allow users to withdraw the the amount that they staked at that timestamp to unstake.
