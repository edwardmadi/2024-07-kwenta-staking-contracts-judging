# A user can use the RewardEscrowV2 to bypass cooldown period constraint in StakingRewardsV2.


## Summary

A user can use the RewardEscrowV2 to bypass cooldown period constraint in StakingRewardsV2.

## Vulnerability Detail

First, let's see how the cooldown period works. According to https://docs.kwenta.io/kwenta-token/staking-kwenta#cooldown-period, whenever a user performs a staking or staking escrow action, the cooldown period is calculated from the last staking action.

> The cooldown period is NEW, and the time required before unstaking your tokens is possible. The cooldown period to unstake your tokens is two weeks & the clock starts ticking from the last time a staker interacted with the v2 staking contracts. This includes adding to your staked balance with liquid $KWENTA or escrow $KWENTA. 

This means if a user stakes two times at T0, T1 (assume T0 < T1), then the cooldown period would be `T1 + cooldownPeriod`.

However, the user can use the `RewardEscrowV2` to bypass this check. Since there is a function for `unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown` in `StakingRewardsV2` that allows users to skip cooldown period.

Users can create an escrow entry in `RewardEscrowV2` with the amount of kwenta tokens they want to stake, and set the duration to `stakingRewards.cooldownPeriod()` (which is the minimum cooldown period that can be set). Then, they can call `StakingRewardsV2.stakeEscrow()` to stake the tokens. Later, when they want to unstake it, they can call `RewardEscrowV2.vest()` to unstake and withdraw it.

The difference between this method and the original staking method is, each stake action is treated separately, and previous stakes can be unstaked as long as cooldown period for that specific stake has passed. It does not have to consider whether there are more stakes in the future. For example:

1. User creates an escrow and stakes it at T0.
2. User creates another escrow and stakes it at T1.

Now if user wants to unstake the amount in T0, originally, he would've need to wait until `T1+cooldownPeriod`. However, by using `RewardEscrowV2`, he can bypass this constraint, and stake it after `T0+cooldownPeriod`. Each stake can be viewed separately, and the staked tokens would be more liquid than before, which should not be expected.

Also, considering that the cooldown time is also updated for each reward claim, it would incentivize more for users to do so.

StakingRewardsV2.sol
```solidity
    function unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown(address _account, uint256 _amount)
        external
        onlyRewardEscrow
    {
        _unstakeEscrow(_account, _amount);
    }
```

RewardEscrowV2.sol
```solidity
    function createEscrowEntry(
        address _beneficiary,
        uint256 _deposit,
        uint256 _duration,
        uint256 _earlyVestingFee
    ) external {
        if (_beneficiary == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        if (_earlyVestingFee > MAXIMUM_EARLY_VESTING_FEE) revert EarlyVestingFeeTooHigh();
        if (_earlyVestingFee < MINIMUM_EARLY_VESTING_FEE) revert EarlyVestingFeeTooLow();
        if (_deposit == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        uint256 minimumDuration = stakingRewards.cooldownPeriod();
        if (_duration < minimumDuration || _duration > MAX_DURATION) revert InvalidDuration();

        /// @dev this will revert if the kwenta token transfer fails
        kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _deposit);

        // Escrow the tokens for duration.
        uint256 endTime = block.timestamp + _duration;

        // Append vesting entry for the beneficiary address
        _mint(_beneficiary, endTime, _deposit, _duration, _earlyVestingFee);
    }

    function vest(uint256[] calldata _entryIDs) external whenNotPaused {
        ...
        // Transfer vested tokens
        uint256 totalWithFee = total + totalFee;
        if (totalWithFee != 0) {
            // Unstake staked escrowed kwenta if needed for reward/fee
            uint256 unstakedEscrow = unstakedEscrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
            if (totalWithFee > unstakedEscrow) {
                uint256 amountToUnstake;
                unchecked {
                    amountToUnstake = totalWithFee - unstakedEscrow;
                }
@>              stakingRewards.unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown(msg.sender, amountToUnstake);
            }
            ...
        }
    }
```

Note that this should not be considered out of scope for this contest, because the `StakingRewardsV2.sol#unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown()` function can be only called by `RewardEscrowV2`, and we must check the use cases of it.
