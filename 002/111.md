# Inconsistent Cooldown Mechanism in Staking Contract

## Summary

The current staking contract enforces a cooldown period based on the most recent staking action. This results in a situation where users must wait for the cooldown period to expire before they can unstake any of their tokens, even if the tokens were staked well before the cooldown period was reset. This design can lead to a suboptimal user experience, as users may find it unfair to wait for the full cooldown period again, despite having previously waited for an extended period.

## Vulnerability Detail

The cooldown period is reset with each new staking action. Consequently, if a user stakes additional tokens after having previously staked a different amount, the cooldown period for the entire balance is reset. This behavior means that users must wait for the cooldown period to expire from the time of the latest stake, which could unfairly penalize them if they have already waited for a previous stake.

```solidity
    function stake(uint256 _amount) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        // update state
        userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
        _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);
        _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) + _amount);

        // emit staking event and index msg.sender
        emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);

        // transfer token to this contract from the caller
        kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }
```

The problem is that there is one mapping for one user: ` userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp` and it is always being set/updated in the last time the user calls `token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol::stake()` function.

For example, if a user stakes 100 tokens and waits for 2 days, then stakes another 100 tokens after those 2 days, the cooldown period for the entire balance is reset. The user would then need to wait for an additional cooldown period before they can unstake any of their tokens, even though the initial stake had already been subjected to the cooldown period.

The same goes for `_stakeEscrow()` function, it is resetting the `userLastStakeTime[_account] = block.timestamp` mapping as well, so if a user stakes escrowed token it will reset the `userLastStakeTime` and user will need to wait the whole cooldown period.

```solidity
    function stakeEscrow(uint256 _amount) external {
        _stakeEscrow(msg.sender, _amount);
    }


    function _stakeEscrow(address _account, uint256 _amount)
        internal
        whenNotPaused
        updateReward(_account)
    {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        uint256 unstakedEscrow = unstakedEscrowedBalanceOf(_account);
        if (_amount > unstakedEscrow) revert InsufficientUnstakedEscrow(unstakedEscrow);

        // update state
        userLastStakeTime[_account] = block.timestamp;
        _addBalancesCheckpoint(_account, balanceOf(_account) + _amount);
        _addEscrowedBalancesCheckpoint(_account, escrowedBalanceOf(_account) + _amount);

        // updates total supply despite no new staking token being transfered.
        // escrowed tokens are locked in RewardEscrow
        _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);

        // emit escrow staking event and index account
        emit EscrowStaked(_account, _amount);
    }
```

But the bigger issue is when `compound()` function is being called, in this case this function calls `_compound()` which in turn calls `_stakeEscrow()` which resets the mapping as mentioned above.

```solidity
    function compound() external {
        _compound(msg.sender);
    }

    /// @dev internal helper to compound for a given account
    /// @param _account the account to compound for
    function _compound(address _account) internal {
        _getReward(_account);
        _stakeEscrow(_account, unstakedEscrowedBalanceOf(_account));
    }
```

## Impact

Users who have already waited for a cooldown period for their initial stake are forced to wait again due to subsequent stakes and compounding.

## Recommendation

Track the cooldown period for each staking action separately. Maintain multiple timestamps for each stake and enforce cooldowns based on the earliest timestamp.
