# Users who stake immediately after notifyRewardAmount is called will get same reward as users who have staked for longer time.

### Summary

Users who stake immediately after notifyRewardAmount function is called gets almost the same rewards as users who have staked for a longer time and have the same number of tokens staked.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L645

### Root Cause

The notifyRewardAmount function sets the periodFinish variable which is used to calculate rewards, when the notifyRewardAmount function has not been called, all users will get zero rewards but as soon as it is called, users can now start getting reward but malicious users can take advantage of this, and only stake after the notifyRewardAmount is called and unstake after the reward distribution time is over and wait for the next time notifyRewardAmount will be called.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. SupplySchedule calls StakingRewardsNotifier

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User stakes 10 kwenta token for 2 weeks before StakingRewardsNotifier is called
2. Malicious user stakes 10 kwenta token after  StakingRewardsNotifier is called

### Impact

Unfair distribution of reward tokens (USDC), users who stake for a longer period should not get the same reward as users who stake for a shorter period.

### PoC

```solidity
   function testUnFairDistribution() public {
        address user1 = makeAddr("user1");
        address user2 = makeAddr("user2");

        // fund so that staking can succeed
        fundAndApproveAccountV2(user1, 10 ether);
        fundAndApproveAccountV2(user2, 10 ether);

        vm.prank(user1);
        stakingRewardsV2.stake(10 ether);

        //fast forward 10 weeks
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 weeks);

         // configure reward rate
        vm.prank(address(rewardsNotifier));
        stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(1 ether, 1 ether);

        vm.prank(user2);
        stakingRewardsV2.stake(10 ether);
      
        //fast forward 2 weeks
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 2 weeks);


        uint256 user1reward = stakingRewardsV2.earnedUSDC(user1);
        uint256 user2reward  = stakingRewardsV2.earnedUSDC(user2);

        assert(user1reward == user2reward);

    }


```
