# Loss of kwenta reward funds when no one is staking

### Summary

When no one is staking, `rewardPerTokenStored` is not increased. As a result, the Kwenta rewards in the contract are not actually being distributed to anyone. 

When `notifyRewardAmount` is called again, the leftover amount is not rolled over to the next staking cycle. Furthermore, `recoverERC20` does not allow the owner to withdraw Kwenta, so the rewards amount for this period where no one is staking is just stuck in the contract. 

### Root Cause

The issue is in `notifyRewardAmount`:

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(
        uint256 _reward,
        uint256 _rewardUsdc
    ) external onlyRewardsNotifier updateReward(address(0)) {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```

Notice how we don't actually roll over any rewards that were not allotted to users into the next cycle. Furthermore, in recoverERC20, we prevent withdrawal of Kwenta, which means that owner cannot even get the unalloted rewards out. 

### Internal pre-conditions

There needs to be some period with no stakers and some amount of kwenta rewards in the contract during that period

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Kwenta rewards will be stuck in the contract and cannot be withdrawn or claimed by stakers

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Easiest method is to allow `recoverERC20` to withdraw kwenta
