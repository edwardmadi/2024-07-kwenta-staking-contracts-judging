# Distribution of USDC to `StakingRewardsNotifier` has issues


## Summary
Impact: 2 impacts depending on USDC distribution to `StakingRewardsNotifier`
1. not possible to stream both USDC and KWENTA rewards together which will result in loss of reward emission to the stakers who are promised X amount for the week epoch
or
2. locked USDC inside the `StakingRewardsNotifier` as DOS 

## Vulnerability Detail
Team is planning to send 10k USDC along with KWENTA weekly mint, but the `SupplySchedule.mint` is open access and allows anyone to call and gives it a reward on line 252 below. So, there's no guarantee that its the team that going to call the mint => which calls `StakingRewardsNotifier.notifyRewardAmount` which actually increases the reward rate on `StakingRewardsV2`. 
So, if the team doesn't just donate 10k USDC to `StakingRewardsNotifier`, then it's not possible to stream both USDC and KWENTA rewards together which will result in loss of reward emission to the stakers who are promised X amount for the week epoch. If USDC is donated to `StakingRewardsNotifier`, then anyone calling `SupplySchedule.mint` will notify reward amounts with both USDC and KWENTA.

If this is not the flow or intention of donating, then its an issue as explained. If this is the intention, then there's another issue.

if USDC rewards are donated before calling mint() for that week, sometimes `SupplySchedule.mint` will revert if the mintable amount == 0, it can be due to rounding issue in accounting on `mintableSupply`. So, its better to implement a recover USDC function on `StakingRewardsNotifier`, or else the amount is lost forever inside that contarct until `SupplySchedule.mint` call flows without reverting.

## Impact
Impact: 2 impacts depending on USDC distribution to `StakingRewardsNotifier`
1. not possible to stream both USDC and KWENTA rewards together which will result in loss of reward emission to the stakers who are promised X amount for the week epoch
or
2. locked USDC inside the `StakingRewardsNotifier` as DOS 
Likelihood looks medium to low, but the imapct is high on lost USDC. And users not getting USDC emitted for the week is medium to high severity.

## Recommendation
Implement a `recoverUSDC` with `onlyOwner` access on `StakingRewardsNotifier`.
