# Users can get more usdc than intended due to wrong calculation in earnedUSDC

### Summary

Users will get more USDC than intended due to wrong calculation in the earnedUSDC function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L472

### Root Cause

In the earnedUSDC function, the calculation uses 1e18 instead of 1e6 when calculating the earnedUSDC of the user. This will cause the user to get more reward than intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. SupplySchedule calls StakingRewardsNotifier

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User Stakes 10 kwenta tokens.
2. After a minimum of 7days, user calls getReward
3. The updateReward modifier calls _updateReward

In the _updateReward function, the rewardsUSDC mapping is being updated, this is where the reward that will be sent to the user is stored. 

```rewardsUSDC[_account] = earnedUSDC(_account);```

The result of the earnedUSDC is being stores inside.

### Impact

With the current calculation of earnedUSDC, the user will get 100000000000000% more USDC than intended and it is important to note that the  rewardPerTokenUSDC function which is also used in calculating the earnedUSDC has the same bug which is mentioned in another report.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The result of the earnedUSDC function should be written to be in 6 decimals instead of 18 decimal.
