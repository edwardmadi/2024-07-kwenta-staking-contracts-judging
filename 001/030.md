# Discrepancy Between Transferred Amount and Expected Amountffected party

### Summary

In the notifyRewardAmount function of the StakingRewardsNotifier.sol contract, the mintedAmount parameter is not handled in the implementation. This can lead to discrepancies between the actual reward distribution and the expected amount. The difference between the excess rewards and the expected amount may pose a risk of financial loss.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88-L95

Missing validation for mintedAmount in the notifyRewardAmount function.

### Internal pre-conditions

The actual transfer amount in the notifyRewardAmount function is processed according to the storage amounts of the reward tokens and USDT in this contract.

### External pre-conditions

The onlySupplySchedule permission needs to pass in the expected mintedAmount quantity and call the notifyRewardAmount function.

### Attack Path

1.The onlySupplySchedule permission calls the token transfer based on the expected amount.
2.The contract performs the transfer based on the actual stored amount.

### Impact

Discrepancies between the transferred amount and the expected amount may lead to potential asset loss and affect the data records in the supply schedule.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add validation for mintedAmount to avoid discrepancies between the transferred amount and the expected amount.
