# Owner can drain USDC from the contract using recoverERC20

### Summary

The missing check to revert if the `_tokenAddress == address(usdc)` will lead to owner draining the StakingRewardsV2 contract.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L711` owner can unstake the USDC token from the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The users will not be able to claim their kwenta and usdc rewards as the `usdc.transfer()` will fail because of absence of USDC token in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following check in `recoverERC20()`:
```solidity
if (_tokenAddress == address(usdc)) revert CannotRecoverRewardsToken();
```
