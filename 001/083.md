# A portion of rewards can remain unused within the StakingRewardsv2 during initial period

### Summary

 A portion of rewards can remain unused within the StakingRewardsv2. 

### Root Cause

The contract logic tracks the total time passed and the cumulative rate of rewards for each token used for rewards. For each user, it keeps track of the last timestamp and last rate at the time of the last reward withdrawal, `stake`, or `unstake` to calculate the rewards owed since the user began staking. The code handles the scenario where there are no users by not updating the cumulative rate when the `_totalSupply` is zero. However, it does not include a condition for tracking the timestamp. As a result, even when no users are staking, the accounting logic updates the starting timestamp, causing funds to be distributed to nobody instead of being saved for future users. These funds end up being locked in the contract forever.

From this LoC, the stake function is missing the update for periodFinish to allow first staker to receive first cycle of reward distribution.

### Internal pre-conditions

1) `notifyRewardAmount` is called with 0 stakers for duration X.
2) User stakes at duration X + Y, which is out of the duration period of X.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

For example, consider the following:

Block N:  StakerRewardsNotifer calls `notifyRewardAmount` for a rewardsToken with a reward intended for distribution for one week (7 days).

Now assume the calculated rewardRate is set to distribute 1 reward token per second. Therefore; rewardRate = 1, periodFinish = Timestamp X + 604800 (one week in seconds).

Block M (Timestamp = X + Y): After Y seconds, the first user stakes, initiating their reward accumulation from Timestamp X + Y. However, note that the periodFinish is X + rewardsDuration, not X + Y + rewardsDuration.

Therefore, this delay (Y) leads to a discrepancy where rewards meant for the initial Y seconds remain undistributed, as the contract's reward distribution window does not start from X + Y + rewardsDuration.

For example, a 30-minute delay (Y = 1800 seconds) results in only 603000 tokens being distributed, leaving 1800 tokens unused in the contract. These tokens stay dormant neither accrueable by any staker (which is ideal) nor withdrawable. It remains stuck temporarily or permanently which is technically a loss.

### Impact

If a certain amount remains unused (like the above example inside the contract), and a new reward cycle is not started, that amount remains dormant, resulting a loss of yield for stakers.

### Mitigation

Consider defining periodFinish in the first stake() that is done after notifyRewardAmount(), when total deposits are zero by following this mitigation:
