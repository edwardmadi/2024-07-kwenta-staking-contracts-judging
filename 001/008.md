# `StakingRewardsV2.recoverERC20` allows owner to rug the `rewardsToken`

## Summary
StakingRewardsV2.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away.
However, there's no check against the rewardsToken which over time will sit in this contract.

This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
## Vulnerability Detail
Calling StakingRewardsV2.recoverERC20(rewardsToken, rewardsToken.balanceOf(this)) enables the owner to sweep the token.
 function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
## Impact
Allows owner to rug the rewardsToken.
