# Precision loss in StakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount

## Summary
Each reward distribution will result in a loss of USDC tokens when `notifyRewardAmount` is called due to Solidity's handling of division rounding

## Vulnerability Detail
`notifyRewardAmount` takes two arguments, `_reward` and `_rewardUsdc`, which are used to calculate the `rewardRate` and `rewardRateUSDC`.
```solidity
if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        }
```
The issue concerns `rewardRateUSDC` because USDC has 6 decimals. This results in precision loss during division, up to `604800` (0.6 USDC) for each distribution period (1 week).
```solidity
rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
// 500e6 / 604800 = 826 (500 USDC for 1-werek period)
// 500e6 - (826 * 604800) = 435200 (0.43 USDC will not be distributed this week and will remain locked in StakingRewardsV2.)
```
Additionally, if `notifyRewardAmount` is called before the 1-week period has elapsed, a different formula will be used, but it will still result in the same issue:
```solidity
else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }
```

## Impact
For each reward duration (currently 1 week), up to 0.6 USDC will remain locked in the `StakingRewardsV2` contract. This amount will accumulate each week.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When calculating `rewardRateUSDC`, it is possible to determine the amount of USDC that will not be distributed to stakers due to precision loss. Simply transfer that amount from the balance of the `StakingRewardsV2` contract at the end of the `notifyRewardAmount` function call.
