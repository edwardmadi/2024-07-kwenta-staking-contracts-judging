# Lack of Validation in `StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount` Function Leads to Transaction Reversion

### Summary

The absence of validation for the `stakingRewardsV2` address in the `notifyRewardAmount` function will cause a transaction reversion for the contract as the `notifyRewardAmount` function will attempt to transfer KWENTA and USDC tokens to an uninitialized `stakingRewardsV2` address (zero address).

### Root Cause

In [StakingRewardsNotifier.sol:88](https://github.com/kwenta/kwenta/blob/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts-0xvivekd/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88), the `stakingRewardsV2` address is not checked for being a valid address before performing token transfers.



### Internal pre-conditions

The `stakingRewardsV2` address is not set (remains the zero address).
The `notifyRewardAmount` function is called by the `SupplySchedule` contract.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

`SupplySchedule` calls `notifyRewardAmount` function
Function attempts to transfer KWENTA and USDC tokens to `stakingRewardsV2` (which is address(0))
ERC20 transfer reverts due to transfer to zero address
Transaction reverts, failing to distribute rewards

### Impact

The reward distribution system cannot execute reward notifications. This prevents the proper functioning of the staking rewards mechanism, effectively stopping the intended functionality of the contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a check in the `notifyRewardAmount` function to ensure `stakingRewardsV2` is set to a valid address before attempting transfers.
