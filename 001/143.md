# In Rewards Notifier, notifyRewardAmount is not correctly implemented

## Summary

Staking rewards configured wrongly in Rewards Notifier contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Based on the system mechanism, supply scheduler can schedule a staking reward event when a new minting occur on supply schedule. 

```solidity
        kwenta.mint(treasuryDAO, amountToTreasury);
        kwenta.mint(address(tradingRewards), amountToTradingRewards);
        kwenta.mint(address(stakingRewards), amountToStakingRewards);
&>      stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(amountToStakingRewards);
        kwenta.mint(msg.sender, minterReward);
    }
```
This amountToStakingRewards parameter is not used in the Reward Notifier contract:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
        uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
        kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
        uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);

&>      stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
    }
 ```

Instead, it directly creates a staking rewards event using current Kwenta balance. Based on the main functionality, this value should be equal to mintedAmount. In the end, anyone can change and increase this staking rewards by sending some Kwenta.

## Impact
Anyone can increase reward amount
Wrong main system functionality

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88C1-L95C6

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
        uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
        kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
        uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
        usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);

        stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Forwarding the mintedAmount parameter to Staking Reward will fix the functionality.
