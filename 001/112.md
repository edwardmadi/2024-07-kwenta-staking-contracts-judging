# Gaming `rewardPerTokenStored` to gain more rewards than intended

## Summary
Impact: loss of funds to new users and attackers gain more reward than intended.
Root cause: allowing to stake when `rewardPerTokenStored == 0`
Likelihood : backrunning deployment or anytime between deployment and first notifyReward call by `SupplySchedule::mint`. So the likelihood looks high too since `SupplySchedule::mint` is possible once a week and a lot of time and amount > 0 constraints inside it.

```

issue flow :
1. `StakingRewardsV2` is deployed and now it's available to staking, so attacker just backruns within next block to call `stake` on L237 above with 100 $KWENTA tokens, so total supply = 100. But before total supply updating on L242, `updateReward` is called. Reward rate == 0, since no reward notify is done ever, and total supply is also 0, so  `rewardPerTokenStored` == 0 and `userRewardPerTokenPaid[attacker]` == 0. Check L444, then L416 then L426.
2. After few hours, days when its available to call `SupplySchedule::mint` ==> `StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount` ==> `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount` on L658 and the reward rate = 200 tokens per day for 1 week in KWENTA (1400e18 total), and 0 USDC (for POC simplicity).
3. Now seeing this reward emission, a user comes in and stakes 100 $KWENTA tokens, which will update rewardPerTokenStored = 1, since total supply = 200 and reward rate is also 200 per day, so `rewardPerTokenStored` = 1 (1 reward per token), and userRewardPerTokenPaid[user] also = 1, but remenber userRewardPerTokenPaid[attacker] is still 0.
4. one week is over and user didn't claim reward yet. Attacker calls `getReward` to claim, the rewardPerTokenStored  is updated to 1400 rewards/ 200 kwenta = 7 rewards per token, which will calculate `rewards[_account]` inside `earned()` by `(totalBalance * (rewardPerToken() - userRewardPerTokenPaid[_account])) / 1e18` = 7 - 0, but it should be instead 7 - 1. 
5. the `userRewardPerTokenPaid[attacker]` should be from first notify checkpoint, not from his stake time where rewardPerTokenStored == 0. This will make the attacker claim more rewards than streamed to him, and when the real user comes to claim his rewards, the action will revert.
6. Imagine if there was already notify reward before anyone could stake which would update `rewardPerTokenStored` = more than 0 and no way 0 rewardPerTokenStored be assigned to staker and the attack wouldn't be feasible. The numbers look small in my POC, but 200, 1400 tokens is very low, real numbers will be in thousands of dollars staked and reward emitted. Also, I didn't include USDC rewards, and the team says 10k per week in a KIP (readme), so the impact is severely high.

## Impact
So, it's a loss of funds to new users by attacker backrunning deployment or anytime between deployment and first notifyReward call by `SupplySchedule::mint`. So the likelihood looks high too since `SupplySchedule::mint` is possible once a week and lot of time and amount > 0 constraints inside it.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
But this could have been prevented by pausing the contract at deployment and unpausing when first notify-reward. But looks like its not the team's intention, because it is calling `__Pausable_init` inside `StakingRewardsV2::initialize` which puts paused = false. So,this attack is feasible right after the next block of deployment. So, my recommendation is to remove `pausable init` and leave the contract in `paused = true` state and unpause it after first `notify reward`.

Or do it like ve(3, 3) dexes, where even the reward per token data is also stored in checkpoints, and when reward calculation, if user reward per toke == 0 then use the first checkpoints data, no plain 0 like in L472 above and point 4 in issue flow.
