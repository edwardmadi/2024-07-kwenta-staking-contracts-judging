# Users might be unable to receive reward if USDC is recovered from the contract

## Summary

If USDC is withdrawn from `StakingRewardsV2.sol` and their are users with > 0 amount of `USDCRewards` then the `getReward` function will revert for those users until there is enough USDC in the contract to send as reward.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `recoverERC20` function in `StakingRewardsV2.sol` allows the owner to transfer out any ERC20 tokens that aren't `kwenta`.

`USDC` is used as a reward token and is sent to users when they call the `getReward` function if their `rewardsUSDC` (which tracks the amount of USDC owed to the account) is > 0. If the USDC balance of the contract is less than the rewards owed to the user then the `getReward` function reverts when it attempts to transfer USDC.

## Impact

Users will be unable to receive their rewards until the contract has enough USDC.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider not allowing USDC to be recovered in the `recoverERC20` function or only transfer USDC in the _getReward function if the balance of USDC in the contract is >= the users owed `rewardsUSDC` amount.
