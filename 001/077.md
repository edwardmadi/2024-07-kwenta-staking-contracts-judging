# StakingRewardsNotifier.notifyRewardAmount() will revert if stakingRewardsV2 contract is not set

### Summary

The missing check in `StakingRewardsNotifier.notifyRewardAmount()` lead to revert with error **ERC20: transfer from the zero address** or leads to rewards burn if a custom implementation burns the tokens if **to** is **address(0)**. 

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88C5-L95C6` there's not check that checks **stakingRewardsV2** is set. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The transaction can revert leads to rewards delays or worse the rewards can get burned if a custom token implementation doesn't check for `to != address(0)`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check as below.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
    require(stakingRewardsV2 != address(0), "Invalid StakingRewardsV2 address!");

    uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
    kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
    uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
    usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);
        
    stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
}
```
