# `rewardPerTokenStored`Â contract can be inflated and rewards can be stolen

### Summary

## Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract is designed to manage staking and reward distribution for participants. The vulnerability arises from the way rewards are calculated and distributed, specifically through the `rewardPerTokenStored` function and its interaction with the `stake` and `unstake` functions.

The core issue lies in how the `rewardPerTokenStored` can be inflated due to the division by `totalSupply` in the `rewardPerToken` function.

The vulnerability can be exploited as follows:

1. A user stakes 1 wei using the `stake()` function.
2. This action updates `totalSupply` to 1 wei and triggers the reward calculation, which inflates `rewardPerTokenStored` due to the division by a small `totalSupply` value.
3. The user then `unstakes` their stake and claims the inflated rewards, draining the reward pool.

Also, early stakers can exploit the reward calculation mechanism by staking a small amount, such as 1 wei (due to the supply math). This action can significantly inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored`, leading to an unfair advantage in the distribution of rewards. The core of this vulnerability lies in the division by a very small `totalSupply` amount when calculating the accumulated rewards per token.

1. **Reward Calculation**:

   ```solidity
   function rewardPerToken() public view returns (uint256) {
       if (totalSupply() == 0) {
           return rewardPerTokenStored;
       }
       return
           rewardPerTokenStored +
           (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRate * 1e18) / totalSupply());
   }
   ```

2. **Staking Logic**:

   ```solidity
    /// @inheritdoc IStakingRewardsV2
    function stake(uint256 _amount) external whenNotPaused updateReward(msg.sender) {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();

        // update state
        userLastStakeTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
        _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() + _amount);
        _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) + _amount);

        // emit staking event and index msg.sender
        emit Staked(msg.sender, _amount);

        // transfer token to this contract from the caller
        kwenta.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
    }

    /// @inheritdoc IStakingRewardsV2
    function unstake(uint256 _amount)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        updateReward(msg.sender)
        afterCooldown(msg.sender)
    {
        if (_amount == 0) revert AmountZero();
        uint256 nonEscrowedBalance = nonEscrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
        if (_amount > nonEscrowedBalance) revert InsufficientBalance(nonEscrowedBalance);

        // update state
        _addTotalSupplyCheckpoint(totalSupply() - _amount);
        _addBalancesCheckpoint(msg.sender, balanceOf(msg.sender) - _amount);

        // emit unstake event and index msg.sender
        emit Unstaked(msg.sender, _amount);

        // transfer token from this contract to the caller
        kwenta.transfer(msg.sender, _amount);
    }
   ```

3. **Checkpoint Logic**:

   ```solidity
    /// @notice update reward state for the account and contract
    /// @param _account: address of account which rewards are being updated for
    /// @dev contract state not specific to an account will be updated also
    modifier updateReward(address _account) {
        _updateReward(_account);
        _;
    }

    function _updateReward(address _account) internal {
        rewardPerTokenStored = rewardPerToken();
        lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();

        if (_account != address(0)) {
            // update amount of rewards a user can claim
            rewards[_account] = earned(_account);

            // update reward per token staked AT this given time
            // (i.e. when this user is interacting with StakingRewards)
            userRewardPerTokenPaid[_account] = rewardPerTokenStored;
        }
    }
   ```

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability comes from the division by `totalSupply` in the `rewardPerToken` function. If `totalSupply` is very small (e.g., 1 wei), this division significantly inflates the `rewardPerTokenStored` value, leading to an artificially high reward calculation for the staker. This allows a single user to inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored` value by staking a minimal amount (1 wei) and subsequently claiming a disproportionately large amount of rewards.

## Impact

The primary impact of this vulnerability is the potential for a single user to:

1. Inflate the `rewardPerTokenStored` value by staking a minimal amount.
2. Claim a disproportionately large amount of rewards.
3. Deplete the reward pool, effectively stealing rewards from other stakers.

## Recommendation

I suggest two things:

1. Implement a minimum stake amount to prevent the `totalSupply` from being too small, which would mitigate the inflation of rewards.
2. Ensure that divisions by `totalSupply` are handled safely, potentially by setting a lower bound for `totalSupply` in the reward calculation logic or add checks to ensure that the `rewardPerToken()` does not result in unrealistic values due to extremely low `totalSupply` amount.
