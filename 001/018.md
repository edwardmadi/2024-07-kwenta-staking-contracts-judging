# Loss of rewards due to continuous griefing attack.

### Summary

In the Optimism L2 environment, low transaction fees enable malicious users to exploit the USDC reward feature, resulting in a loss of `USDC` rewards.

### Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises because `USDC` (6 decimals) is used as a reward, and `rewardRateUSDC` is not normalized to 18 decimals in a contract that uses an 18-decimal `KWENTA` staking token and the `1e18` constant for precision in rewards calculations.

This allows malicious users to conduct low-cost griefing attacks by calling the `stake()` function to trigger the `_updateReward()` function, effectively nullifying the USDC rewards. 

This is achieved by updating `rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC` with a `+0` value and incrementing the `lastUpdateTime`.

Example scenario with real-life data:

- Initially, 10k USDC per week is allocated for rewards for a few weeks.
- The live contract `StakingRewardsV2: 0x61294940CE7cD1BDA10e349adC5B538B722CeB88` (without USDC rewards) has a `totalSupply` of `797162774225639498906491`. We will use this value to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- Assuming the last period has ended for easier calculations and the `rewardsDuration` is 7 days.

1. The `notifyRewardAmount()` function is called with 10k USDC, resulting in a new `rewardRateUSDC`:

```solidity
File: StakingRewardsV2.sol
652:             rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc /rewardsDuration;
```
```text
   rewardRateUSDC = 10000 * 10**6 / 604800 = 16534
```

2. A malicious user initiates a griefing attack by calling `stake(1)` -> `updateReward(msg.sender)` -> `_updateReward(_account)`. 

This updates two key storage variables in `_updateReward(_account)`:

```solidity
 File: StakingRewardsV2.sol
 412:         rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC = rewardPerTokenUSD();
 413:         lastUpdateTime = lastTimeRewardApplicable();
```

To deny users USDC rewards and lock USDC in the     StakingRewardsV2 contract, the malicious user performs  griefing at intervals such that `rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC`   remains unchanged, and only `lastUpdateTime` is updated. 

Using the live contract values, we can determine the time   intervals and the attack's cost:

```solidity
File: StakingRewardsV2.sol
454:         return rewardPerTokenStoredUSDC
455:             + (((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRateUSDC * 1e18) / allTokensStaked);
```

The attack interval is approximately 48 seconds, as calculated below:

```text
(((lastTimeRewardApplicable() - lastUpdateTime) * rewardRateUSDC * 1e18) / allTokensStaked) needs to be 0, this give us:

(x * 16534 * 10**18) / 797162774225639498906491 < 1

which give us around 48 seconds. (48 * 16534 * 10**18) / 797162774225639498906491 will be 0 in Solidity do to the rounding error.
```

If the attacker calls `stake()` every 45 seconds for a week, with a cost of around 0.00000042 ETH per call:

```text
604800 / 45 * 0.00000042 = 0.0056448 ETH â‰ˆ $18
```

Thus, it costs about $18 to deny USDC rewards to all users and lock `10000 USDC` in the StakingRewardsV2 contract.

### Impact

Rewards accounting for users will be broken, leading to a direct loss of rewards.

Even if the funds can be recovered by the protocol using the `recoverERC20()` function, properly reconstructing the reward distribution for each user would be nearly impossible.

In addition, the `recoverERC20()` function is meant to be updated to disallow the recovery of `USDC` as the Kwenta protocol intends to prevent the withdrawal of reward tokens by admin. This change has already been confirmed.

### Tool used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

Normalize the `_rewardUsdc` amount to `1e18` when calculating `rewardRateUSDC` in the `notifyRewardAmount()` function:

```diff
if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
    rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
-   rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
+   rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc * 1e12 / rewardsDuration;
} else {
    uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;
    uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
    rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
    uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
-   rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
+   rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc * 1e12 + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
}
```

When claiming rewards in the `_getReward()` function:

```diff
-uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account];
+uint256 rewardUSDC = rewardsUSDC[_account] / 1e12;
if (rewardUSDC > 0) {
    rewardsUSDC[_account] = 0;
+   rewardsUSDC[_account] -= rewardUSDC * 1e12;
    emit RewardPaidUSDC(_account, rewardUSDC);
    usdc.transfer(_to, rewardUSDC);
}
```
