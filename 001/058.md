# Ignoring `mintedAmount` Parameter Can Lead to Over-Distribution of Rewards (`StakingRewardsNotifier::notifyRewardAmount`)

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

The `StakingRewardsNotifier` contract is designed to notify the `stakingRewardsV2` contract about the reward amounts. The [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsNotifier.sol#L88-L95)  function is responsible for transferring the reward tokens (`KWENTA` and `USDC`) to the `stakingRewardsV2` contract. However, the function currently transfers the entire balance of these tokens held by the contract, ignoring the `mintedAmount` parameter, which is intended to represent the newly minted tokens for the current reward period.

The function takes a `mintedAmount` parameter but does not use it, leading to the transfer of all tokens held by the contract. This can result in over-distribution if the contract holds more tokens than the intended reward amount due to previous accumulations or other transfers. The function should use the `mintedAmount` parameter to ensure that only the correct amount of newly minted tokens is transferred and notified as rewards.

> Relevant code:
```solidity
File: StakingRewardsNotifier.sol
88:     function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
89:         uint256 currentBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
90:         kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalance);
91:         uint256 currentBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
92:         usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), currentBalanceUsdc);
93: 
94:         stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(currentBalance, currentBalanceUsdc);
95:     }

```

## Impact
The lack of usage of the `mintedAmount` parameter can lead to over-distribution of rewards. If the contract holds more tokens than the intended reward amount, it will transfer all tokens, leading to an over-distribution. This can undermine the intended incentive structure and result in an uneven distribution of rewards among stakers. Stakers who are aware of this issue could gain an advantage over those who are not.

## Proof of Concept
1. The contract is supposed to distribute 1000 `KWENTA` tokens as rewards for the current period.
2. Due to previous accumulations or other transfers, the contract holds 2000 `KWENTA` tokens.
3. The `notifyRewardAmount` function is called with `mintedAmount` set to 1000.
4. The function transfers all 2000 tokens to the `stakingRewardsV2` contract, leading to an over-distribution of 1000 tokens.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Modify the `notifyRewardAmount` function to use the `mintedAmount` parameter to transfer the exact amount of tokens intended for rewards. Ensure that the contract has sufficient balance before transferring the tokens and verify the balances after the transfer to ensure correctness. Here is the recommended fix you guys should consider:

```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 mintedAmount) external onlySupplySchedule {
    // Ensure the minted amount is transferred
    uint256 initialBalanceKwenta = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(initialBalanceKwenta >= mintedAmount, "Insufficient Kwenta balance");
    kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), mintedAmount);
    uint256 finalBalanceKwenta = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalBalanceKwenta == initialBalanceKwenta - mintedAmount, "Incorrect Kwenta transfer");

    uint256 initialBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(initialBalanceUsdc >= mintedAmount, "Insufficient USDC balance");
    usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), mintedAmount);
    uint256 finalBalanceUsdc = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));
    require(finalBalanceUsdc == initialBalanceUsdc - mintedAmount, "Incorrect USDC transfer");

    stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(mintedAmount, mintedAmount);
}
```
