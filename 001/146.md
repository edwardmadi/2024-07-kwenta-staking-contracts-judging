# Zero RewardRate will Halt Reward Distribution for Stakers

## Vulnerability Detail
If the `notifyRewardAmount()` function is called with a zero `_reward` amount, and the first `if` condition passes, the code will execute `rewardRate = 0 / rewardsDuration;` resulting in `rewardRate` being set to zero. Consequently, all functions dependent on `rewardRate` will yield incorrect values. For instance, the `getRewardForDuration` function will return zero.
## Impact

1. **`getRewardForDuration` Function**:
   - This function returns the total reward amount for the specified duration.
   - If `rewardRate` is zero, the returned reward amount will be zero (`rewardRate * rewardsDuration`).

2. **`rewardPerToken` Function**:
   - When `rewardRate` is zero, the `rewardPerToken` calculation will not increase as the additional reward amount per token will be zero.
   - This means `rewardPerTokenStored` will remain the same over time until `rewardRate` is updated again.


3. **`updateReward` Modifier**:
   - The `_updateReward` internal function, which updates the `rewardPerTokenStored` and `lastUpdateTime`, will effectively result in no changes to `rewardPerTokenStored` due to zero `rewardRate`.
   - Consequently, user rewards (`rewards[_account]` and `rewardsUSDC[_account]`) won't increase as `rewardPerToken` doesn't change.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be an `if` condition that reverts the transaction if `rewardRate` is set to zero.
