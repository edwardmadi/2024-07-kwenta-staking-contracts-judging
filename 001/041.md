# USDC rewardRate precision error may lead to non-trivial rounding error.


## Summary

USDC rewardRate precision error may lead to non-trivial rounding error. For 1000 USDC rewarded with a rewardDuration of 1 week, the rounding loss is ~0.027%.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `notifyRewardAmount` is called, the reward rate (amount of tokens distributed per second) is recalculated based on the amount of reward token. The issue is for USDC (6 decimals), the precision error may be non-trivial.

The default `rewardsDuration` is 1 week (`3600*24*7 = 604800`). The amount of USDC rewarded per `notifyRewardAmount()` call is not documented, will use 1000 USDC as example here:

- rewardRateUSDC = 1e9 / 604800 = 1653
- total USDC distributed = rewardRateUSDC * 604800 = 1653 * 604800 = 999734400

Amount of loss = (1e9 - 999734400) / 1e9 = 0.0002656


```solidity
@>  rewardsDuration = 1 weeks;

    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
@>          rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
@>          rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```

## Impact

For 1000 USDC rewarded with a rewardDuration of 1 week, the rounding loss is ~0.027%. Should be non-trivial since Sherlock's consider >0.01% to be a "loss of funds".

## Recommendation

Scale up the `rewardRateUSDC` by 1e18 to avoid precision error.
