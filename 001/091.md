# StakingRewards: recoverERC20() can be used as a backdoor by the owner to retrieve rewardsToken..

## Summary
StakingRewardsV2.recoverERC20 rightfully checks against the stakingToken being sweeped away. However, thereâ€™s no check against the rewardsToken. This is the case of an admin privilege, which allows the owner to sweep the rewards tokens, perhaps as a way to rug depositors.
`   function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
        if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
        emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
        IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
    }
}`
## Vulnerability Detail
The developer didnt account for USDC and only made a check for staking tokens(kwenta) which cant be sweeped away,due to no check for USDC which can make it stop being sweeped away,this can be possible way to rug depositors

## Recommendation
Add an additional check
`         require(
            tokenAddress != address(USDC),
            "Cannot withdraw the rewards token"
        );`
