# `rewardRate` will be griefed with each invoke of `notifyRewardAmount`

## Summary
Each call of [`notifyRewardAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L645-L666) recalculates `rewardRate`, dividing it by the total `rewardsDuration` instead of remaining one
## Vulnerability Detail
For the sake of simplicity, assume that there are `_reward`= 1000 and `rewardsDuration` = 10 periods meaning `rewardRate` will be 100 tokens per period
```solidity
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        }
```
5 periods pass and the method is invoked with `_reward` = 200
remaining duration = 5 periods  
leftover = 5 * 100 = 500 tokens to be distributed  
rewardRate = (200+500) / 10 periods = 70 tokens per period
```solidity
         else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;


            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration; // @audit division by entire duration
        }
```
Each invoke of the function with `_reward` being less than the already paid out reward will result in `rewardRate` decrease of both KWENTA and USDC rewards.  
In cases where there aren't any USDC rewards accumulated in `StakingRewardsNotifier.sol`, the reward rate will just decrease, directly causing harm to users without a benefit.
```solidity
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration; // huge grief in case _rewardUsdc = 0 
```



## Code Snippet
```solidity
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Impose the following check
```solidity
         else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            previousRewardRate = rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;
            require(rewardRate >= previousRewardRate, "RR decrease");
         }
```
