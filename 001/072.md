# Precision loss of `rewardRateUSDC` in the `notifyRewardAmount()` function

## Summary

The formula `rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;` can lead to precision loss because `_rewardUsdc` (the USDC reward amount) is relatively small, given that USDC has only 6 decimal places.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's analyze the calculation of `rewardRateUSDC` at `L652`. The value of `rewardsDuration` is 604800 (1 week). If `_rewardUsdc` is 604799, then `rewardRateUSDC` will be 0, treating the actual USDC reward as if it were nonexistent. This means that the total USDC reward amount of 604799, equivalent to $0.604799, does not contribute to the reward distribution. Furthermore, even if `_rewardUsdc` exceeds 604800, the amount represented by `_rewardUsdc % 604800` (up to $0.604799) will be excluded from the reward distribution.

```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
652         rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
660         rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```

## Impact

Some of the received USDC, up to $0.604799, does not contribute to the reward distribution.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use scaled USDC reward amounts.
