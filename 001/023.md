# Insufficient Validation in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount` function

## Summary
Insufficient validation of `rewardRate` in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount` function may result in loss of funds and damage to certain functions of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StakingRewardsV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount` function is a function that configures `rewardRate` based on the amount of tokens (KWENTA, USDC) to be distributed during the period.
However, there is no check if `rewardRate` is greater than 0 in this function.
This can lead to the loss of reward fund within the contract.
The `rewardRate`(or `rewardRateUSDC`) is calculated by the amount of reward tokens sent from the `StakingRewardsNotifier` contract and the amount of reward tokens still available in the contract.

    ```solidity
    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
        rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
        rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
        rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

        uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
        rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
    }
    ```
That is, if the amount of reward tokens used to calculate `rewardRate` (or `rewardRateUSDC`) is less than `rewardsDuration`, `rewardRate` can be 0.
As a result, rewards will not be distributed from the current point in time (`block.timestamp`). Also, reward tokens (specifically KWENTA) used to configure `rewardRate` cannot be recovered by the `recoverERC20` function, so they are permanently locked in the contract.

```solidity
function recoverERC20(address _tokenAddress, uint256 _tokenAmount) external onlyOwner {
--> if (_tokenAddress == address(kwenta)) revert CannotRecoverStakingToken();
    emit Recovered(_tokenAddress, _tokenAmount);
    IERC20(_tokenAddress).transfer(owner(), _tokenAmount);
}
```

## Impact
Some rewards may not be distributed and may be permanently locked in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add the following line of code to the `StakingRewardsV2.sol#notifyRewardAmount` function.
```solidity
    function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
        external
        onlyRewardsNotifier
        updateReward(address(0))
    {
        if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
            rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
            rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
        } else {
            uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
        }

+++     require(rewardRate > 0, "Error");
+++     require(rewardRateUSDC > 0, "Error");

        lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
        periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
    }
```
