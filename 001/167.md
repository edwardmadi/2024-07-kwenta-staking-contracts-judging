# Reward Rate Dilution Caused by Zero Reward Inputs in the StakingRewardsV2 Contract

## Summary
The `notifyRewardAmount` function in the "StakingRewardsV2" contract can inadvertently reduce the reward rates for KWENTA or USDC when called with a zero reward amount of one reward token( e.g when there is either no KWENTA or USDC) to distribute  during an active reward period.
## Vulnerability Detail
This issue arises due to how the notifyRewardAmount function updates the rewardRate and rewardRateUSDC. These rates are recalculated by dividing the sum of the new reward amounts and the remaining rewards of the ongoing period by the rewardsDuration. When a zero reward is introduced, it leads to a redistribution of the remaining rewards over the same period, thereby decreasing the reward rate
```solidity

            uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
            rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

            uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
            rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
```
## Impact
 Dilution of reward rates diminishing the expected yield for token holders,

## Recommendation
Introduce logic bypass rate recalculations when the added reward amount is zero during active active reward period
