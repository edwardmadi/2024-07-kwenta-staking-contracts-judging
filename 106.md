# [H-1] `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` variable is not update after `StakingRewardV2::stake`, `StakingRewardsV2::unstake`, `StakingRewardsV2::_stakeEscrow`, `StakingRewardsV2::unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown` functions call, This will lead to lost the checkpoints struct array for certain address and will lead to loss of funds and break some function call like `StakingRewardsV2::nonEscrowedBalanceOf`

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` variable in the provided smart contract is used to keep track of the staked token balances of each address over time. This is done by storing an array of `Checkpoint` structures for each address. Each `Checkpoint` contains a timestamp, a block number, and the balance value at that point in time. if this isn't handle and updated correctly this will lead to: 

- **Inaccurate Balance Tracking**: The primary purpose of the `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` array is to keep track of the balances at different points in time. If this array is not accurately updated, users' balances will not reflect their actual holdings. This can lead to incorrect calculations of rewards and lost of funds for user, staking amounts, and unstaking processes.
    
- **Incorrect Reward Distribution**: Rewards are typically calculated based on the amount of tokens staked by a user over a certain period. If `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` is not correctly updated, users might receive less or more rewards than they are entitled to. This could lead to disputes and dissatisfaction among users.
    
- **Unintended Reverts**: Many functions in the contract rely on the accuracy of the `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` array. For instance, the `StakingRewardsV2::nonEscrowedBalanceOf` function, which depends on both `StakingRewardsV2::balancesCheckpoints` and `StakingRewardsV2::escrowedBalancesCheckpoints`, could revert if these checkpoints are not aligned. This can prevent users from performing actions like staking, unstaking, or claiming rewards.

## Impact
If the `balancesCheckpoints` is not handle correctly(update when user stake or unstake) then it will lead to user lost it's funds or some user steal rewards more than it's reward amount. We would appreciate it if you could focus on our recent efforts. 


## Tool used

Manual Review, VS Code

## Recommendation

update the `balancesCheckpoints` carefully when certain functions calls happen include stake function, unstake function, _stakeEscrow function.

## POCs 
Dear sir, I am new in web3 space my foundry skills is not as good as I right a POCs, but I believe this is a bug and it break the functionality and lead to losing of funds. hopefully you check carefully my report and focus on this issues.
