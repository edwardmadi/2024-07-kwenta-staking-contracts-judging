# StakingRewardsV2.setRewardsDuration` allows setting near zero or enormous `rewardsDuration`, which breaks reward logic

## Summary
notifyRewardAmount will cease to produce meaningful results if rewardsDuration is too small or too big.
## Vulnerability Detail
The setter does not control the value, allowing zero/near zero/enormous duration:

 function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }


## Impact
notifyRewardAmount will fail if rewardsDuration is too small or too big.

## Tool used
Check for min and max range in the rewardsDuration setter, as too small or too big rewardsDuration breaks the logic.
