# Cannot set `RewardsDuration` in function `setRewardsDuration` because of wrong comparison between `block.timestamp` and `periodFinish`.

## Summary
Wrong comparison between `block.timestamp` and `periodFinish` in `setRewardsDuration`
## Vulnerability Detail
If we call `setRewardsDuration` function when `block.timestamp` is equal to `periodFinish`, then it reverted with `RewardsPeriodNotComplete().`
But in this case, this setting condition is correct and there's no reason to revert.
## Impact
It doesn't work correctly when `block,timestamp = periodFinish`.
Exact rewards period is [start, end). here end is `periodFinish`.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L670
```solidity
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
@>        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change <= to < so set correct rewards duration [start, end)
```diff
    function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
-        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
+        if (block.timestamp < periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
        if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

        rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
        emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
    }
```
