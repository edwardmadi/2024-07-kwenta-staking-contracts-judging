# Unbounded `rewardsDuration` can cause Overflow, DoS, and Negligible Rewards in `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount`

### Summary

The `StakingRewardsV2::setRewardsDuration` function allows setting an arbitrarily large rewards duration without an upper limit. This unbounded `rewardsDuration` can cause arithmetic overflow in the `StakingRewardsV2::notifyRewardAmount` function during the calculation of the `rewardRate`. 

Such an overflow can lead to incorrect reward rate values and setting the `periodFinish` to extremely distant dates, potentially causing a denial of service (DoS) condition and other severe issues.

### Root Cause

From the [`StakingRewardsV2.sol:669`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L669-L675) contract, in the `setRewardsDuration()` function, we check if `_rewardsDuration` is not 0 but we don't enforce a limit on the value `_rewardsDuration` can holds:

```solidity
function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
    if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
    if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();

@> rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration; // @audit - What is the upper limit?
    emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
}
```

Consequently, when a `StakingRewardsNotifier` initiate a reward notification, the `rewardRate` and `rewardRateUSDC` are set to a very small value in [`notifyRewardAmount():645`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/0527fb7425206a3338c23177416436c6286cedf9/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L645). `periodFinish` is set to a date far in the future.
```solidity
function notifyRewardAmount(uint256 _reward, uint256 _rewardUsdc)
    external
    onlyRewardsNotifier
    updateReward(address(0))
{
    if (block.timestamp >= periodFinish) {
@>      rewardRate = _reward / rewardsDuration;
@>      rewardRateUSDC = _rewardUsdc / rewardsDuration;
    } else {
        uint256 remaining = periodFinish - block.timestamp;

        uint256 leftover = remaining * rewardRate;
@>      rewardRate = (_reward + leftover) / rewardsDuration;

        uint256 leftoverUsdc = remaining * rewardRateUSDC;
@>      rewardRateUSDC = (_rewardUsdc + leftoverUsdc) / rewardsDuration;
    }

    lastUpdateTime = block.timestamp;
@>  periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
    emit RewardAdded(_reward, _rewardUsdc);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- The owner sets an extremely large `rewardsDuration`.
- A reward amount is then notified by the `StakingRewardsNotifier`.
- In `notifyRewardAmount`, the calculation of `rewardRate` results in an extremely small value due to division by the large `rewardsDuration`.
- This small `rewardRate` causes rounding errors, reducing rewards to negligible amounts, thus preventing users from earning significant rewards.
- The `periodFinish` is set far into the future, making it impossible to update `rewardsDuration` until this period ends.

### Impact

This vulnerability can cause the following issues:

1. Arithmetic errors, such as overflow, leading to transaction reverts, or precision loss, resulting in users receiving incorrect rewards.
2. Contract locking or inoperability, due to an extremely distant `periodFinish`, which prevents setting new rewards or updating existing rewards until the period elapses.
3. Unfair distribution of rewards, where small or incorrect `rewardRate` values lead to disproportionate reward allocation and increased gas costs due to complex calculations with large numbers.

        assertLt(earnedRewards, 1e9, "Earned rewards should be extremely small due to low rewardRate");

        // Print results for analysis
        console.log("Reward Rate:", rewardRate);
        console.log("Period Finish:", periodFinish);
        console.log("Earned Rewards after 30 days:", earnedRewards);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement an upper bound for `rewardsDuration` to prevent excessively large durations:

```diff
+ uint256 public constant MAX_REWARDS_DURATION = 365 days;

function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
    if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
    if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();
+   if (_rewardsDuration > MAX_REWARDS_DURATION) revert RewardsDurationTooHigh();

    rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
    emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
}
```

This change ensures that the rewards duration cannot be set to an unreasonably large value, preventing potential overflows and maintaining the intended functionality of the reward distribution system. The specific value of `MAX_REWARDS_DURATION` can be adjusted according to the system's expected usage and requirements.
