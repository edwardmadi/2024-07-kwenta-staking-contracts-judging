# The `StakingRewardsV2.setRewardsDuration()` function can be Dosed

## Summary
The `setRewardsDuration` function can only be successed when `block.timestamp` is bigger than `periodFinish`. However, anyone could extend `periodFinish` easily by calling `SupplySchedule.mint()`. As a result, The `setRewardsDuration` function can be Dosed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `StakingRewardsV2.setRewardsDuration()` sets `rewardsDuration` as a new parameter.
However, if `block.timestamp` is smaller than `periodFinish`, this function is reverted from L670.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/tree/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L670
```solidity
670:    if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
```
A malicious attacker can call `SupplySchedule.mint()` every 1 week to transfer reward tokens to the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` contract receiving 1e18 `Kwenta`.
In the `SupplySchedule.mint()` function, 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/tree/main/token/contracts/SupplySchedule.sol#L251-L252
```solidity
251:     stakingRewards.notifyRewardAmount(amountToStakingRewards);
252:     kwenta.mint(msg.sender, minterReward);  // @audit-info caller receives 1e18 Kwenta
```

This sets `periodFinish` as `block.timestamp + rewardsDuration` from L664.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/tree/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L664
```solidity
664:     periodFinish = block.timestamp + rewardsDuration;
```
Furthermore, the initial value of `rewardsDuration` is set as `1 weeks` in the `initialize` function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/tree/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L187
```solidity
187:     rewardsDuration = 1 weeks;
```
So if a malicious attacker call `SupplySchedule.mint()` every 1 week and call this function earlier than an Owner's call to the `setRewardsDuration` function, Owner's transaction will be reverted.

## Impact
The `setRewardsDuration` function can be Dosed.

## Recommendation
Remove the conditional check in the `setRewardsDuration` function.
Even though the variable `rewardsDuration` is updated as new value before previous period, it doesn't affect reward distribution.  
```diff
     function setRewardsDuration(uint256 _rewardsDuration) external onlyOwner {
-        if (block.timestamp <= periodFinish) revert RewardsPeriodNotComplete();
         if (_rewardsDuration == 0) revert RewardsDurationCannotBeZero();
 
         rewardsDuration = _rewardsDuration;
         emit RewardsDurationUpdated(rewardsDuration);
     }
```
