# Snipe rewards to earn risk free USDC

## Summary

Kwenta distributes rewards on weekly bases, these reward distributions can be frontrun to earn large share of USDC rewards risk free.
Currently user has to stake Kwenta tokens to earn rewards. He has to stake for at least 2 weeks which makes his position subject to price changes. This can be avoided by hedging against this position. (Open Kwenta short position on any dex or cex)

In case there is high trading activity, and the anticipated USDC rewards are high, this could allow any whale to claim unfair amount of USDC trading rewards without exposing to risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

Kwenta pays rewards in USDC and Kwenta. Currently there is a withdraw cooldown of 2 weeks, forcing users to commit there capital for at least 2 weeks to earn rewards. This should discourage short term staking.
Current problem evolves with distributing rewards as USDC, a token with a really predictable price.
In case there is large trading activity and the USDC fees are high, a whale could deposit a large amount of Kwenta right before the reward distribution to earn a large part of rewards.
He could hedge his position on any dex or cex by short selling Kwenta, making his total position immune to price changes.
This will reward him with the USDC fees, risk free.

For example:
- 100k USDC trading fees are distributed.
- the current staked supply is 1000 kwenta
- A whale buys 1000 kwenta on the open market, and deposits these
- he create a short position (for example on a perp market) of 1000 kwenta
- he earns 50k USDC in rewards, has to pay the perp fee
- profit

## Impact

Risk free "MEV" trade allows to earn USDC staking rewards.
