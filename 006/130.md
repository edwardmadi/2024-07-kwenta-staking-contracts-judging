# Malicious Users will still earn rewards for escrowed kwenta tokens they don't have.

### Summary

On the call to [`RewardEscrowV2#vest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/RewardEscrowV2.sol#L351C4-L412C6)  anyone can vest kwenta tokens that are still staked in [`StakingRewardsV2`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol) allowing them to earn rewards on escrowed tokens they have already vested(withdrawn from the `StakingRewardsV2`).

### Root Cause

**The Issue arises due to the following combination of facts:**
- When Escrowed tokens are [staked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L242) in StakingRewardsV2 it is added to the user's [`balanceOf()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L242) there.
- On the call to [`vest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/RewardEscrowV2.sol#L351C2-L412C6) in `RewardEscrowV2` it allows the user to withdraw all the escrowed tokens(**even the staked ones**) given the `entry.endTime` has been reached or crossed.
-  On the call to [`earned()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L464C1-L469C6)/[`earnedUSDC()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-07-kwenta-staking-contracts/blob/main/token/contracts/StakingRewardsV2.sol#L472C2-L477C6) It uses the same balance of the user in with the `rewardPerToken` to determine the rewards the user has earned for a reward period(or several reward weeks).

### External pre-conditions

Users should not earn more rewards than they have staked or escrowed. However, given the users can `vest()` their Kwenta tokens without regard to the ones they staked in `StakingRewardsV2` they will accumulate more rewards than they're supposed to.

### Attack Path
- Reward week 1, users  A, B, and C stake their tokens in the StakingRewardsV2 and wait for a while to gain rewards.
- UserB sees this attack pathway and calls `RewardEscrowV2#createEscrowEntry()`  to get some `totalEscrowedAccountBalance` in the `RewardEscrowV2`.
- UserB calls `StakingRewardsV2#stakeEscrow()` to stake his escrowed token.
- UserB leaves his stake until his `entry.endTime` is reached or crossed to be able to `vest()`.
- On the call to `RewardEscrowV2#vest()` he gains back the full amount he escrowed in the `RewardEscrowV2`.
- In `StakingRewardsV2` the contract still accounts that UserB still has Escrowed funds, which is accounted for in UserB `balanceOf()`, `escrowedBalanceOf()`, and in the `totalSupply()`.
- Allowing UserB to still gain rewards for all the time he leaves his stake in the `StakingRewardsV2.sol` untouched, such that on the call to `getRewards()` he gets more rewards than supposed to.

### Impact

The user tricks the system to gain more rewards than supposed to.

### PoC
You can see on the call to `vest()` a user can vest all their escrowed tokens even the ones staked in `StakingRewardsV2.sol`.
```solidity
    function vest(uint256[] calldata _entryIDs) external whenNotPaused {
        uint256 total;
        uint256 totalFee;
        uint256 entryIDsLength = _entryIDs.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < entryIDsLength; ++i) {
            uint256 entryID = _entryIDs[i];
            if (_ownerOf(entryID) != msg.sender) {
                continue;
            }

            (uint256 quantity, uint256 fee) = _claimableAmount(_unpackVestingEntryStruct(entryID));

            // update entry to remove escrowAmount
            vestingSchedules[entryID].escrowAmount = 0;
            _burn(entryID);

            // add quantity to total
            total += quantity;
            totalFee += fee;
        }

        // Transfer vested tokens
        uint256 totalWithFee = total + totalFee;
        if (totalWithFee != 0) {
            // Unstake staked escrowed kwenta if needed for reward/fee
            uint256 unstakedEscrow = unstakedEscrowedBalanceOf(msg.sender);
            if (totalWithFee > unstakedEscrow) {
                uint256 amountToUnstake;
                unchecked {
                    amountToUnstake = totalWithFee - unstakedEscrow;
                }
                stakingRewards.unstakeEscrowSkipCooldown(msg.sender, amountToUnstake);
            }

            // update balances
            totalEscrowedBalance -= totalWithFee;
            totalEscrowedAccountBalance[msg.sender] -= totalWithFee;//@audit
            totalVestedAccountBalance[msg.sender] += total;

            // Send 50% any fee to Treasury and
            // 50% to RewardsNotifier
            // UNLESS Distributor isn't set
            // then send all funds to Treasury
            if (totalFee != 0) {
                /// @dev this will revert if the kwenta token transfer fails
                uint256 amountToTreasury = totalFee / 2;
                uint256 amountToNotifier = totalFee - amountToTreasury;
                kwenta.transfer(treasuryDAO, amountToTreasury);
                kwenta.transfer(rewardsNotifier, amountToNotifier);
                emit EarlyVestFeeSent(amountToTreasury, amountToNotifier);
            }

            if (total != 0) {
                // Transfer kwenta
                /// @dev this will revert if the kwenta token transfer fails
                kwenta.transfer(msg.sender, total);
            }

            // trigger event
            emit Vested(msg.sender, total);
        }
    }
```

### Mitigation

On the call to `RewardEscrowV2#vest()` create checks to ensure that user cannot vest their staked escrow tokens.
